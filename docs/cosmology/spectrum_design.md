# Spectrum module design — numerical polology for the cosmology program (H6 / WS6)

**Status:** design settled 2026-09-03 (H6). **This document is the authority for WS6.**
Tracking: #495 (WS6), umbrella #488, decision D6. (#360 was the earlier PSALTer tracker; it
is **closed as superseded** by this design — its per-sample architecture and its target
module, `tidal/inference/_psalter_bridge.py`, are both retired.)

**Amendment ledger.** Seven inline corrections, each pinned to **PSALTer v2.0.2 @
`bb45adb0`** — a later release may restore assumed behavior, and an unqualified "this is
dead" would then be wrong in the other direction. Corrections are inline rather than a
silent rewrite, so an implementer reading an instruction reads its correction with it.

| § | line | Source | What changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| §4.1 | 229 | H8 | Missing-coupling failure behavior is **silence** — `NonLinearCouplings` is never thrown (#522) |
| §4.5 | 374 | H8 | `Method` is declared but **never read** (#521) |
| §6.1 | 494 | H8 | PSALTer emits **none** of the assumed contract; two association keys plus private `$Local*` globals (#523) |
| §5 | 538 | coherence pass | "PSALTer **guarantees** linearity" was the justification under the whole per-sample performance argument. It does not; enforcement is ours (#522) |
| §13 | 783 | coherence pass | The third `Method→"Hard"` site, which the first amendment pass **missed**; §13 retitled EXECUTED by H8 |
| §14.1 | 832 | H8 | The cost risk stands, but the number to report is plain `ParticleSpectrum` wall time |
| §14.2 | 838 | H8 | The harvest surface is identified; labels are read, not assumed |

H8 read the PSALTer sources live and found **four** instruction sites resting on assumptions
the release contradicts; the coherence pass added three more (§5, §13, and the count in this
paragraph, which previously said "four" and had stopped being true). That the ledger itself
drifted is the point of keeping one: it is the mechanism meant to catch exactly the gap that
left §13 un-amended for a day.

Route and rationale: `docs/cosmology/stage1_engineering_plan.md`; issues #521, #522, #523.
**Scope:** design only — no code in this document's commit. Module implementation is WS6
proper; the Wolfram-side Stage-1 engineering is proposed as its own handoff (§13).

## TL;DR

**Problem.** The cosmology pipeline must screen out vacuum-sick theories (ghosts, tachyons)
before spending compute on them, at arbitrary coupling values, in milliseconds per point —
the regime where symbolic computation dies of expression swell (arXiv:2606.30785).

**Design.** Two stages. **Stage 1** (once per Lagrangian structure, Wolfram, unmodified
symbolic PSALTer): our auto-generated export turns the theory's vacuum Lagrangian into
PSALTer's input, and PSALTer's run *discovers the structure* — the wave-operator blocks, which
modes are massive/massless, gauge ranks, source constraints, and closed-form health conditions
where they exist. **Stage 2** (per coupling sample, JAX): a numerical evaluator consumes that
structure and returns a health verdict in order milliseconds. The primary ghost/tachyon
algorithm is the **Schur-complement kinetic-matrix criterion** of arXiv:2506.02111 — published,
worked, and implemented nowhere — which fits our theories (massless graviton/photon kinetically
mixed with massive torsion), avoids radicals and residues, and carries parity-violation support
with it. The residue route from the released code is implemented alongside it as a permanent
cross-check. The massless sector — which the released code guards out, and which our program
cannot ignore — is handled by counting (free), compiled Stage-1 closed forms, and a numerical
massless-residue fallback.

**Next step.** Dispatch the proposed Stage-1 handoff (§13): install PSALTer, stand up the
spectrum derivation branch and exporter. WS6 proper then implements Stage 2 against §12's
validation set.

**Done when** the seven validation groups of §12 pass — headline gates: the three
Lin–Hobson–Lasenby inequalities reproduced (the WS6 gate in `docs/COSMOLOGY_PROGRAM.md`),
agreement with the published implementations, the TorC and Einstein–Cartan oracles, GR+Maxwell
healthy, and a median per-sample verdict ≤ 1 ms.

## 1. The two-stage architecture

Numerical polology does **not** replace symbolic PSALTer; it consumes its output.
arXiv:2606.30785 §implementation-appendix ¶Platforms, verbatim:

> "An initial application of computer algebra is required to extract the symbolic
> `M_n^{J^P}` from `S(θ)`, and this problem was previously solved for any theory of the form
> given in [eq. EFTLag] by the Wolfram Language implementation in [Barker:2024juc,
> Barker:2025qmw]. The remainder of the pipeline is implemented in Python, specifically within
> the JAX framework."

Confirmed in the code: the published JAX entry point is `sample(wxf_path, …)`, and
`_extracting/wxf.py` reads `xAct`PSALTer`WaveOperator` out of a PSALTer-emitted WXF file. No
path in the numerical implementation accepts a Lagrangian.

| | **Stage 1** — once per Lagrangian *structure* | **Stage 2** — per coupling *sample* |
| --- | --- | --- |
| what | Lagrangian → wave-operator blocks, **plus structure discovery**: gauge ranks, the massive/massless mode partition, source-constraint matrix, massless content, closed-form conditions where obtainable | blocks + coupling vector → masses, ghost/tachyon verdict |
| where | Wolfram, symbolic PSALTer (unmodified — we generate its input and harvest its output, both from outside) | JAX, our module — adapted from the released code **and extended** with the unimplemented Schur criterion (§5) |
| cost | minutes–hours, amortized; one-wolframscript rule applies | **order milliseconds** (Barker's stated target) |

Stage 1 is not a necessary evil. It is where the structural facts that make Stage 2 both
correct and fast are discovered — which sectors are gauge-degenerate and by what rank, which
modes are massive vs massless (the Schur reordering), the constraint matrix, how many genuinely
massless polarizations exist. Those facts are what let Stage 2 use fixed shapes (§9) and what
the massless verdict asserts against (§6).

## 2. Purpose and scope

The module is a **screening gate**: theories/points that fail never reach the solver. Its
verdicts are **Minkowski-vacuum** statements, and that is sufficient by the same split TorC
used (spectrum screens in vacuo; dynamics evolve on FRW). Three honesty clauses, stated here
rather than footnoted:

- **One-way filter.** A vacuum-healthy verdict says nothing about behavior on a background
  (`B ≠ 0`, FRW); vacuum-sick is a reason to discard, vacuum-healthy is not a certificate.
- **Necessary, not sufficient.** Linear (tree-level, free-spectrum) health only; strong
  coupling and non-linear pathologies are out of scope.
- **Parity-odd status.** Symbolic PSALTer supports parity-violating theories today
  (arXiv:2506.02111 upgraded it); the published *numerical* work restricts to parity-preserving
  ("may be applied in future work", arXiv:2606.30785 §implementation fn. 9). Our chosen
  algorithm (§5) is where parity violation already lives, so support arrives as a consequence
  rather than as extra work — in scope, and what gates O4/#499's Chern–Simons couplings.

**Term-roster scope (user decision, 2026-09-03):** curvature-squared terms (`R̃²`-type, the
old `b5`) are **excluded** — their perturbation theory is problematic and we will not sample
them. Direct `(∇T)²` torsion kinetic terms (as in the thesis's T-series) are **in**, and are
degree 2 in momentum — inside the wave-operator contract. The `k⁴` degree assertion in the
code becomes a misconfiguration guard rather than a live limitation.

## 3. Reference hierarchy and provenance policy

**Citable sources** (everything load-bearing in this document stands on these):

- arXiv:2606.30785 — "Numerical polology" (Barker, Handley, Hobson, Lasenby, Marzo, Santoni,
  Torcellini). Local: `literature/2606.30785/`.
- arXiv:2406.09500 — PSALTer v1. Local: `literature/2406.09500/`.
- arXiv:2506.02111 — PSALTer v2, parity-violating; the Schur-complement criterion. Local:
  `literature/2506.02111/`.
- `github.com/wevbarker/SupplementalMaterials-2607` — the companion repository (verified live
  2026-09-03): `Julia/`, `JAX/`, `WolframLanguage/` including committed
  `ParticleSpectrograph<Name>.wxf` exports and `*_unitarity_NS` chains.
- arXiv:2507.09228 — TorC. Local: `literature/2507.09228/`.

`psalter.tar.gz` at the repo root is a WIP snapshot the author sent us; it is **cited nowhere**
here, but it is not off-limits: it carries pieces absent from the release (a JAX draft of the
`U`-likelihood, a per-sample classifier, cubed-sphere tile geometry, recursive sampling) that
the implementation may adopt where they are the best available, with provenance recorded.
Where it *disagrees* with the release, investigate the difference — it can be a fix, an
experiment, or a regression — with the release as the presumption, not an automatic winner.

**Provenance policy** (author permission is explicit — D6): heavy, deliberate inspiration and
copying from Barker's code is authorized; every borrowed function records in its docstring
what came from where, in the form:

```text
Adapted from SupplementalMaterials-2607 Julia/src/run/evaluator/unitarity.jl
(find_gauge_modes), arXiv:2606.30785 eqs. (BlockMatrix)-(RegularizedWaveOperator).
Changes: fixed-shape projectors decided per structure (see spectrum_design.md §9).
```

Formal attribution is settled with the supervisor at publication time. License: TIDAL is MIT
(`pyproject.toml:7`), the released `psalter` is GPL-3.0-or-later — recorded on #495 as a
**release** blocker (the trigger is distribution), with options ranked there: (a) relicense
our side GPL-3.0-or-later, (b) separately-licensed subpackage behind a process boundary,
(c) written permission. Design consequence carried regardless: the spectrum module's
dependencies are one-directional — the package calls into it, it calls back into nothing.

### 3.1 The two published implementations are the paper's two halves

They are not two ports of one thing; learn from both:

| | **Julia** (`Julia/`) | **JAX** (`JAX/src/psalter/`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| implements | the paper's **tuned** case — survey coupling space for the unitary sub-volume of a theory whose particle content is known | the paper's **untuned** case — *discover* theories on measure-zero decoupling hypersurfaces |
| driver | `run.jl` + YAML; nested sampling on the `U`/compression unitarity likelihood | `sample(wxf_path, …)`: NS on the residual `Likelihood_Det` → LM refine → measure → reweight |
| evidence | examples `FierzPauliTheory`, `FierzPauliProcaTheory`, `TDiffTheory`, `VectorTheory` with `*_unitarity_NS` outputs — i.e. the paper's figs. `fp`/`fpp`/`tdiff`/`mv`; configs carry `nlive: 10000`, `scale: 10.0`, matching the stated `10⁴` live points and `λ = 10` | tests `A23Theory`, `S123Theory`, `TensorTheory`, `VectorTheory` with `*_spin{zero,one,two}_direct_sphere` outputs |
| carries | **gauge regularization** (`evaluator/unitarity.jl`), the **soft unitarity likelihood**, **mass dimensions**, **emergent symmetries**, phenomenology reweighters | the fast per-sample kernels: WXF ingest, Vandermonde det coefficients, companion-matrix roots, Kato residues, compile/jit/vmap idioms |

**"Tuned" and why we are squarely in it.** Tuned = the couplings already satisfy relations
producing a *known* particle content (Fierz–Pauli, Maxwell, Proca are the paper's examples);
the only question is where in coupling space that content is healthy. Our theories are exactly
this — PGT+EM's `J^P` content is settled literature (Sezgin–van Nieuwenhuizen, Karananas,
Blagojević, Lin–Hobson–Lasenby) — with one caveat and one resolution. Caveat: for a *new*
combination of torsion kinetic terms the content is not always known a priori (this project's
own history: the T-series kinetic sectors; the implicit-dynamical-sector findings of GH
issues 457/468). Resolution: **the symbolic PSALTer run tells us what propagates, and that puts us
in the tuned case** — Stage 1 computes the content per structure, the discovered content
becomes the declared baseline the per-sample verdict asserts against, and the survey asks
where parameter choices keep it healthy. The untuned machinery (decoupling residuals, LM
refinement) is never needed: we always hold one specific Lagrangian, not a search over theory
space. Content can still change *within* coupling space (a kinetic term degenerates, an
accidental symmetry appears, a mass hits zero) — those are flagged findings (§6, §8), never
scores; the Julia emergent-symmetries machinery is the purpose-built diagnostic if a theory
needs such loci mapped.

There is a second sense in which our theories are tuned, and it explains the code split: tuned
loci are *where gauge symmetries live*. That is why the tuned (Julia) implementation carries
`find_gauge_modes` and the regularized wave operator, and the untuned (JAX) one — whose
appendix assumes "no gauge symmetries" — does not.

**So `Julia/` is the reference implementation of our exact use case**, and the *shape* of its
per-sample flow is the one to adopt (`evaluator.jl`): `wave_operator(c)` → sector evaluation →
masses → **early return if not healthy** → and only then derived quantities. The verdict needs
only the front half: v1 ships the gate, and the tail — **mass dimensions** (needed the moment
anyone wants masses on a physical scale; the bare verdict never does) and **emergent
symmetries** — is *explicitly deferred*, with the extension point exactly where `evaluator.jl`
continues after its early return.

**References are algorithm sources, not language commitments.** The entire Stage-2 algorithm
is implemented in **JAX** (jit + vmap, fp64) — that is where the ms budget is won — with NumPy
only off the hot path. Nothing obliges a Julia runtime; algorithms carry over.

### 3.2 Reconciliation with H4's package design (`docs/cosmology/repo_reshape.md`)

H4 landed before this study and its `tidalcosmo/spectrum/` README anticipates revision by H6.
What H6 **confirms**: the module lives at `tidalcosmo/spectrum/`, on the sampling path,
feeding `validity/` and the Cobaya prior surface (H4 §6 — "WS6 is not independent"); it is
built at **M∥** in the migration order, wired in before the first observable rung; the verdict
is a flag with a reason through the shared flagged-rejection mechanism (H6's payload in §10
realizes that); per-sample speed is a requirement (D5). And **#513** — adopt CAMB and PSALTer
conventions natively, no conversion layer — is confirmed independently here with a hard
technical reason H4 did not have: the parity factor in every ghost verdict is *defined by* the
signature (§4.3). Adopted from H4 §2.8 without change: PSALTer's vocabulary (`Theory`,
`Sector`, `couplings`, `tiles`) wherever it means the same thing, and the frozen-dataclass
settings idiom for `tidalcosmo/config/`.

What H6 **revises** in H4 §2.8's PSALTer picture, which was written from the WIP tarball
before this study established the published record: the released JAX package's API differs
from the tarball's (no `evaluate`/`classify`/`tile` surface; the untuned driver instead), the
tuned pipeline — our use case — is the **Julia** implementation (§3.1), and the "emit WXF or a
schema PSALTer's `extract` can consume" alignment item is **superseded**: the WXF interchange
as it exists is insufficient for our theories (unlabeled `J`-blocks, placeholder slots — §6.1),
so our Stage-1 exporter emits the richer §6.1 contract, and Stage 2 grows the Schur criterion
that exists in no released code (§5). None of this re-litigates H4 — its own README invites
exactly this revision.

## 4. Stage 1: conventions and input contract — native, not converted

**Design principle:** the spectrum-facing symbolic branch is written *in the Barker ecosystem's
conventions from the start*, so its quadratic Lagrangian is PSALTer-ready by construction and
no conversion layer exists to maintain or get wrong. Legacy TIDAL conventions are not
inherited here (WS1: the new package is designed whole, from the goal backwards).

### 4.1 The input form is the ecosystem's definition of theory space

arXiv:2606.30785 eq. `EFTLag`: `S(θ) = ∫d⁴x Σᵢ θᵢ Oᵢ` — every operator carries its own
coupling, with mass dimensions *derived*, not assumed (eq. `MassRescaling`). arXiv:2506.02111
§TheoreticalDevelopment restates it as a wave-operator requirement: "a homogeneous, linear
parametrization … its every term must be linear in these couplings."

So "a symbolic coupling on every term" is not a PSALTer quirk to patch in — it is the
definition of the theory space the method operates on. Contract rules:

- **Reject, never auto-assign.** A Lagrangian term with a bare numeric coefficient (`−¼F²`)
  is a config error with a hint naming the term. Auto-assigning would silently invent a
  parameter the user never declared and then report verdicts and posteriors in terms of it.
  This matches PSALTer's own posture (it validates — `ValidateLagrangian.m`,
  `EnsureLinearInCouplings.m` — and the paper leaves even `α = ½` free "because PSALTer
  requires that all terms … be linearly parameterised"); confirm the exact failure behavior on
  a live install (§13).

  > **Amendment (H8, 2026-09-04 — verified against PSALTer v2.0.2 @ `bb45adb0`):** the failure behavior is
  > **silence**, and the rule is ours alone to enforce (#522). `ValidateLagrangian.m` defines
  > `ParticleSpectrum::NonLinearCouplings` but **never throws it**; it throws only `Zero`,
  > `UnknownCoupling`, `UnknownField` and `NonQuadraticFields`. A bare numeric coefficient is
  > not a `Variable`, so nothing rejects it. `EnsureLinearInCouplings.m` exists, but under
  > `ConstructSourceConstraints/ConjectureNullSpace/`, clearing denominators in a null vector
  > — it is not a Lagrangian validator. The live check is still worth running, to confirm the
  > silence and to capture the `UnknownCoupling` wording (which *is* thrown, for a genuinely
  > undeclared symbol) for our own hint. Enforcement moves entirely to our config layer,
  > which makes this contract rule more load-bearing, not less.
- **Fields**: real tensors, rank ≤ 3, from the enumerated symmetry list (identical in v1 and
  v2): scalar; vector; rank-2 general/`[μν]`/`(μν)`; rank-3 general plus eight symmetrizations
  including `ζ_{μ[νσ]}`. **Torsion `T^λ{}_{[μν]}` is exactly that class** (PSALTer's
  `RegisterFieldRank3Antisymmetric23`). Validate at config load, `error_with_hint` otherwise.
- **Sources are PSALTer's business.** `DefField` defines each field's conjugate source and
  `ParticleSpectrum` appends the source coupling itself; we supply only the quadratic field
  part and assert nothing linear in the fields survives. Sources reach us only as *output we
  read*: `ComponentSourceConstraints` is the constraint matrix, and the massless residue
  eigenvalues live on the reduced source space (§6).
- **No distinguished `κ`.** Neither reference paper has a κ convention to match — polology's
  couplings are generic `θᵢ`; **TorC has no Einstein–Hilbert term at all**
  (`literature/2507.09228/paper_Qtorsion.tex:171-180`: the EH term is emergent from
  condensation; its conditions `λ ≥ 0`, `μ < 0`, `(ν+2μ)(ν−μ) > 0` involve no κ). Give the EH
  operator its own generic coupling like every other operator; the mass-dimension machinery
  then works as designed. Nothing in the numerical code assumes a κ convention.

### 4.2 Field normalization: what matters and what does not

- The **sign** of `h` (`g − η` vs `η − g`) is verdict-irrelevant: `h → −h` is an invertible
  field redefinition; the quadratic action transforms by congruence, preserving pole positions
  and residue signs.
- **Positive rescalings** (`h → λh`, a `κ`/`M_p` absorbed into the field) are also
  verdict-irrelevant (residues scale by `λ² > 0`).
- Both **matter for oracle comparisons** at the matrix level (the overall factor in §5's
  published `K₀` is convention-laden) and for mapping couplings onto literature conditions.

**Rule: bare `h_{μν} ≡ g_{μν} − η_{μν}`, plus sign, no rescaling, throughout the spectrum
branch** — matching TorC's post-Riemannian form (and its tetrad analogue, the Kronecker gauge
`e_i{}^μ ≡ δ_i{}^μ + f_i{}^μ`, `paper_Qtorsion.tex:588`). xPert's `DefMetricPerturbation`
already produces exactly this bare `h`. PSALTer itself imposes nothing — `h` is whatever field
the quadratic Lagrangian is written in. The CAMB side has its own `h_{ij}` conventions
(synchronous gauge, Ma–Bertschinger), and the solver branch is free to adopt them — per-branch
native applies to field conventions too.

### 4.3 Signature: two ecosystems, opposite conventions, one answer per branch

| | signature | `ε` | source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Barker ecosystem (PSALTer v1/v2, polology) | `(+,−,−,−)` | `ε₀₁₂₃ = +1` | 2606.30785:364 ("the particle physics signature"); 2506.02111:100; 2406.09500 ¶Conventions |
| CAMB/CLASS ecosystem (Ma–Bertschinger) | `(−,+,+,+)` | — | `literature/astro-ph_9506072/9506072.tex:295`: `ds² = a²(τ){−dτ² + (δᵢⱼ + hᵢⱼ)dx^i dx^j}` |
| legacy TIDAL | `(−,+,+,+)` | `ε₀₁₂… = −1` | `tidal/wolfram/CommonUtilities.wl:31-33` |

"Adopt the other package's standard" therefore has two different answers, and that is fine:
**spectrum branch → Barker-native; solver branch → CAMB-native** (where legacy TIDAL already
sits). Signature and `ε` are declared, machine-checked properties of each derivation, never a
global project constant. The two branches never exchange tensors (§4.5), so nothing is
converted anywhere.

Where the signature actually enters the spectrum branch (the content of "native"): the branch
never evaluates components — PSALTer does its own SPO decomposition — but three things are
signature-tied even at abstract-index level: (1) the `ε·ε` contraction identities (they carry
the sign of `det g`), so parity-odd terms expand differently; (2) the sign conventions of the
curvature/torsion definitions and of the EH-type operator; (3) any
`ToCanonical`/`ContractMetric` simplification, which uses the session's declared metric. Being
native costs nothing: the emitted script is standalone and PSALTer pre-defines its own
`M4`/`G`/`epsilonG`/`CD` (reserved indices `a`–`z`) and forbids tampering — the branch simply
works in that geometry from its first line.

**The hard reason a conversion layer is forbidden:** arXiv:2506.02111 (SPO normalization
appendix) fixes the parity of a state by `P ≡ sgn(ζ*·ζ)` **"due to our choice of signature"**,
and the appendix's Hermitization step is exactly multiplication by `diag(1, −1)` on the parity
blocks. The parity factor that multiplies every residue — `parity_sign` in the released code —
is therefore *defined by* the signature; a conversion layer is precisely where a ghost verdict
would silently flip sign. `docs/tex/pgt_stability_priors.tex` §"Literature cross-check" (the
worked signature/Proca reconciliation for the torsion sector) changes role accordingly: from
conversion recipe to the one-time reconciliation against legacy results (validation (e)).

### 4.4 Covariant derivatives are expanded away before handoff

PSALTer's `CD` is the flat derivative — `CD[-m]@` **is** `∂_μ` (2406.09500 ¶"Loading the
software"). Our Lagrangians use `CDT`, the torsionful Riemann–Cartan connection. The spectrum
branch therefore reduces everything to `η`, `∂` and the perturbation fields: post-Riemannian
decomposition (connection → Levi-Civita + contortion, contortion → torsion via
`K^a{}_{bc} = ½(T^a{}_{bc} + T_b{}^a{}_c − T_{bc}{}^a)`), then quadratic expansion about
`(η, T̄ = 0)`. Christoffel and torsion couplings appearing explicitly is the point, not a side
effect. The design of this stage exists in legacy TIDAL
(`tidal/cli/_derive.py::_wls_torsion_curvature_decomposition`, line 2088 — `ChangeCurvature[L,
CDT, CD]` plus the contortion identity) and is ported, not imported (WS1's no-adapters rule).

This lands the analysis in the **post-Riemannian / Einstein–Cartan formulation** — fields
`(h_{μν}, T^λ{}_{μν}, a_μ)` — matching TorC's `ParticleSpectrographTorCECT` (15 gauge
generators), not the tetrad + spin-connection `…TorCPGT` (21). That choice fixes which
published spectrograph is the primary oracle (§12c).

### 4.5 Two derivation branches, not one derivation with a fork

| | **spectrum branch** | **solver branch** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| background | Minkowski vacuum | FRW with `a(η)` |
| background fields | absent from its input (separate solver-only config block) | kept and central (the `B` field is the physics) |
| product | quadratic **Lagrangian** | linearized **EOM** |
| representation | abstract index, never evaluated to components | components |
| conventions | Barker `(+,−,−,−)`, `ε₀₁₂₃ = +1` | CAMB `(−,+,+,+)`, conformal `τ` |

They differ in every row: **two derivations from one input**. The solver branch does not
detour through the PSALTer-shaped quadratic Lagrangian — it goes straight to the EOM, which is
faster and what it needs.

**Shared: everything convention-free.** Config parse and validation; field declarations and
symmetry-class classification; the coupling roster and its bookkeeping; the term-level
Lagrangian structure; gauge-symmetry declarations; scope guards. That shared input model is
decided once and consumed by both branches. **Duplicated: only the convention-laden symbolic
work** — the post-Riemannian rewrite (it carries curvature-sign conventions) and everything
downstream. Run it inside each branch's own session; measure later whether the duplication is
worth optimizing.

**Input architecture (fits H4's config design).** The config separates into a **Lagrangian
block** in ecosystem-aligned vacuum covariant form — the shared input model — and a
**background block** consumed only by the solver branch. This slots into H4's `tidalcosmo/config/`
typed-config layout (`docs/cosmology/repo_reshape.md` §2.8, §2.11); designing the background
block's content is WS2's job within that layout, and it is genuinely richer on FRW than the
legacy uniform-`B₀`-on-Minkowski setup (time-dependent, possibly stochastic fields). Related
legacy loss: the plane-wave 1-D reduction speedup (`∂_x = ∂_y = 0`) is unlikely to survive FRW
with structured backgrounds — assume full derivations.

**Gauge treatment is necessarily different per branch — by requirement.** The spectrum branch
hands PSALTer the **gauge-unfixed** quadratic Lagrangian: finding the gauge symmetries and
imposing source constraints is PSALTer's own job. The solver branch applies its own gauge
choices (CAMB-side conventions; the evolved `[[gauge]]` machinery). What must agree is the
**gauge-invariant content**: spectrum verdicts are gauge-invariant by construction, and
cross-branch comparisons compare gauge-invariant quantities (effective signs, invariant
combinations — the existing comparison rules in `.claude/rules/wolfram.md`); the solver side's
`gauge_certificate` culture already flags gauge-dependent numbers there.

**Spectrum-branch order:** (1) consume the vacuum Lagrangian block only, asserting no
background quantity leaks in; (2) `ChangeCurvature` + contortion→torsion; (3)
`Perturbation[·,2]` + `ExpandPerturbation` about `(η, T̄ = 0)` → the quadratic Lagrangian, in
Barker-native conventions from the start; (4) emit `DefField`s from the validated field specs
and `DefConstantSymbol` per coupling, pre-expand derived fields (`F = dA`), assert nothing
linear in the fields; (5) emit a **standalone** `.wls` running `ParticleSpectrum`
(`Method→"Hard"`, `MaxLaurentDepth→1`) plus our own export (§6.1). Model the generator on
`tidal/cli/_derive.py::{_wls_fields,_wls_lagrangian}` + `tidal/cli/_wls_helpers.py`; model the
emitted script on the published `WolframLanguage/ParticleSpectroscopy/{FieldKinematics.m,
Models/*.m}`.

## 5. The algorithm choice: Schur-complement kinetic matrix, residues as cross-check

arXiv:2506.02111 §MassiveSpectrum proposes a no-ghost criterion that "does not involve any
inversion of the wave operator nor the computation of residues of the propagator at massive
poles". It is fully laid out — derivation in its `NoGhostCriterionAppendix`, two worked
examples — and **implemented nowhere**: "our new method is not yet implemented in PSALTer, but
we illustrate its use" (§ECSpectroscopy). Per `J` sector:

1. **Reorder** rows/columns of the sector coefficient matrix into
   `Õ_J = [[O_VV, O_VL], [O_LV, O_LL]]` — massive modes in `O_VV`, massless modes in `O_LL`,
   their kinetic mixings off-diagonal (eq. `canonical_block_structure`).
2. **Block-diagonalize** by the unit-triangular congruence (eq. `tilde_OJ`); the **Schur
   complement** `Ô_VV = O_VV − O_VL O_LL⁻¹ O_LV` "encodes all the information about the
   massive spectrum" and decomposes as `Ô_VV = K_J k² + M_J`, with `K_J`, `M_J` functions of
   the couplings only (eq. `DiagonalizedWaveOperator`).
3. **No ghost ⟺ `K_J` negative-definite** (eq. `kin_matrix_negative`).
4. **Masses** = eigenvalues of `−K_J⁻¹ M_J`; no-tachyon = all real-positive, testable for a
   2×2 via `tr² − 4 det > 0 ∧ tr > 0 ∧ det > 0` (eq. `mass_constraints`).

**Why it is the primary algorithm here:**

- **It targets our exact difficulty.** The paper: the residue criterion "becomes extremely
  difficult … the complications are due to the presence of massless modes and — more
  specifically — because of their kinetic mixings with the massive ones", with
  **Einstein–Cartan gravity as the worked example**. PGT+EM — massless graviton and photon
  kinetically mixed with massive torsion — is that hard case as our default case.
- **It is cheaper and better conditioned** — the ms budget's best friend: per sector, one
  small inverse, two products, a definiteness test (Cholesky), one small eigenproblem. It
  replaces det-coefficient recovery → polynomial roots → per-root SVD → per-root residue, and
  it **eliminates the Abel–Ruffini problem outright** (masses are eigenvalues, never
  closed-form roots — the polology paper flags exactly this failure of closed forms).
- **It is where parity violation lives.** The blocks are chequer-Hermitian
  (2506.02111:234: Hermitian diagonal blocks, skew-Hermitian off-diagonal, states ordered
  `P=+1` then `P=−1` within each `J`), and the generalized residue criterion
  `NoGhostCriterionMixed` — `Res(tr Ô⁺_{J,+} − tr Ô⁺_{J,−}) > 0` — is derived in the same
  appendix. One implementation delivers the ghost verdict, the massive–massless mixing
  treatment, and parity-odd support together.
- **It is genuinely unimplemented** — a real contribution, plausibly the "finishing the
  numerical package so it can handle these theories" the supervisor described. **Planned and
  attempted, not proposed-and-gated**; tell the supervisor (it is a contribution to his
  package, and he may have work in flight).

**Caveats, all checkable:** `O_LL` must be invertible, so gauge modes are removed first
(PSALTer's Moore–Penrose gauge fixing does this) — the method *relocates* the gauge problem
into Stage 1 rather than removing it (§8), which is precisely what shrinks its per-sample
burden. The massive/massless reordering is structural — a Stage-1 discovery, fixed-shape per
structure (§9). Chequer-Hermitian bookkeeping is a genuine trap: PSALTer's convention for the
parity-violating SPOs differs from Karananas's by a factor of `i` (`app:PGT_comparison`;
either is valid), and getting it wrong flips ghost verdicts — the published `K₀` below must be
reproduced including its `i`'s.

**Cross-check discipline (a design principle, not just a validation item):** implement the
residue route alongside, never as a second production path — the shipped verdict and soft
likelihood always come from the Schur quantities. The two criteria are proven equivalent, so
any disagreement localizes a bug immediately; and our Schur implementation can additionally be
checked against the *published* residue implementations (JAX kernels; Julia
`evaluate_sectors_with_regularization`), giving an external oracle to an algorithm that
otherwise has none.

### 5.1 Published worked examples — the validation oracles

**`ScalarParityViolatingPGT`** (2506.02111 §ECSpectroscopy): the most general parity-indefinite
Einstein–Cartan action propagating the graviton plus two scalars,

```text
S = ∫d⁴x e [ c₁R + c₂H + c₃R² + c₄RH + c₅H² + c₆T_{μνρ}T^{μνρ} + c₇T_{μνρ}T^{νρμ}
             + c₈T_μT^μ + c₉ε^{μνρσ}T_{λμν}T^λ_{ρσ} + c₁₀ε^{μνρσ}T_{μνλ}T_{ρσ}^λ ]
```

(`H` the Holst pseudoscalar). Published targets, in increasing order of what they test:

| target | value | tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| massless graviton no-ghost | `c₁ < 0` (eq. `massless_noghost`) | the massless path on EC field content |
| the four `J = 0` blocks | printed in eq. `tilde_OJ_actual` | reordering and block identification — a checkable *intermediate* step |
| kinetic matrix | `K₀ = 6·[[−4c₅, ic₄],[ic₄, c₃]]` | Schur complement + chequer `i` convention |
| mass matrix | `M₀` in eq. `eq:kin_mass_matrices` (Υᵢ abbreviations from the spectrograph; `Υ₁+Υ₃ = 2c₁`) | same, plus abbreviation handling |
| no-ghost verdict | `c₅ > 0 ∧ 4c₃c₅ − c₄² > 0` (⟹ `c₃ > 0`) | definiteness test end to end |
| no-tachyon verdict | eq. `no_tachyon_cond_3`, **fully explicit in bare couplings**: `(2c₆−c₇+3c₈)[(2c₁−2c₆+c₇−3c₈)(c₁−4(c₆+c₇)) + 8(c₂+c₁₀−2c₉)²] > 0 ∧ (2c₆−c₇+3c₈)(2c₁−2c₆+c₇−3c₈) < 0` — "the well-known constraints [Blagojević]" | the `−K⁻¹M` eigenvalue test end to end |
| gauge generators | **10** (Poincaré redundancy; no accidental symmetries) | Stage-1 gauge-rank discovery |

Intermediate matrices being published — not just final inequalities — is what makes this a
usable oracle for an algorithm with no reference implementation.

Two more facts from the same figure caption that shape this design: PSALTer **halts** its
symbolic analysis "once it has been determined that the square masses are not rational
functions of the Lagrangian coupling coefficients", so its exported closed-form conditions
resolve *only the graviton* for this theory — i.e. **for exactly our theory class, L0 (§6) is
partial and the numerical massive path is not optional**; and the improved algorithm "not yet
implemented in PSALTer" recovers the rest — which is what we implement.

**Second oracle:** `app:PGT_comparison` — general parity-violating PGT; masses "identical to
[Karananas:2014pxa]", no-tachyon conditions matching Blagojević, no-ghost "almost trivially by
inspection" via the same method; and the spin-one sector contains **no massless propagating
particles** (gauge redundancies) — a counting check for §6.

## 6. What Stage 1 hands over, and the massless sector

### 6.1 The export

The committed `ParticleSpectrograph<Name>.wxf` files (decoded 2026-09-03 with a minimal WXF
reader) show what PSALTer can emit and what our own exporter must add:

> **Amendment (H8, 2026-09-04 — verified against PSALTer v2.0.2 @ `bb45adb0`):** PSALTer emits **none** of it —
> there is no WXF writer in the package (#523). `ParticleSpectrum.m:87-101` writes exactly two
> association keys, `WaveOperator` and `PseudoDeterminant`, and `DumpSave`s the association to
> `ParticleSpectrograph<Name>.mx`. The richer keys below therefore come from an uncommitted
> curation step in the polology work — which is also why key names vary between exports
> (§6.1's own observation): they were assembled by hand, not by one writer. The real in-kernel
> harvest surface is those two keys plus eight `xAct`PSALTer`Private`` globals
> (`$LocalSourceConstraints`, `$LocalMasslessSpectrum`, `$LocalSpectrum`,
> `$LocalUnresolvedPoles`, `$LocalOverallUnitarity`, `$LocalSummaryOfTheory`,
> `$LocalWaveOperator`, `$LocalPropagator`; `ParticleSpectrum.m:74-81`). Reading private
> symbols makes the installed revision a correctness input: pin the commit, record it in every
> export, and let the fixture tests fail loudly if a name moves. Free consequence: the `.mx`
> dump is a second serialization of every run, and the committed
> `ParticleSpectrographCTEG.mx` in `SupplementalMaterials-2506b` is a ready-made oracle.

- `…TDiffTheory.wxf` (gauge theory) has **populated**: `WaveOperator` (the sector blocks);
  `PseudoDeterminant`; **`UnitarityConditions`** in closed form
  (`Theta1<0 ∧ Theta3<0 ∧ …`); `ComponentSourceConstraints` — the constraint matrix of
  2406.09500 eq. `MatrixEquation` in explicit components with `En`, `Mo` and
  `SourceRank0/1/2Symmetric` heads, **coupling-independent** (structural gauge symmetries);
  `ComponentSaturatedPropagator` (a 646 KB rational expression).
- `…TensorTheory.wxf`: `UnitarityConditions = Text["(Demonstrably impossible)"]`;
  `ComponentSourceConstraints` empty. Both cases must be handled.
- `…VectorTheory.wxf` / `…A23Theory.wxf`: several slots are *unevaluated placeholder symbols*,
  and key names vary (plural vs singular) between exports → read the association keys and
  normalize; never hardcode; treat a bare symbol as absent. The two small files are ready-made
  unit-test fixtures.

**Block labeling — settled by decoding `…A23Theory.wxf`.** The A23 field (rank-3, antisym in
the last pair — torsion's class, 24 components, `J^P` content `0±,1±(×2),2±`) exports
**three** `WaveOperator` entries of dims 2, 4, 2: `2·1 + 4·3 + 2·5 = 24` ✓. These are
**`J`-blocks containing both parities**, with the `J = 1` block visibly `2+2` block-diagonal
(parity decoupled, as it must be for a parity-preserving theory) — 2506.02111's ordering
convention, observed in the wild. The released JAX `SPIN_LABELS = ["0+","1-","2+","3-",…]`
positional convention is therefore wrong even for the release's own test theory once a field
carries both parities. **Our export carries explicit per-state `J^P` labels; position is never
a label.** (Parity feeds the Hermitization `diag(1,−1)` and hence every ghost verdict — §4.3.)

**Exported form: coupling-linear coefficient tensors, not symbolic matrices.** Each block is
`A[n,0] + Σᵢ cᵢ·A[n,i]` with `A` numeric — no sympy/lambdify on the per-sample path, exact and free `∂M/∂c`, expression swell
kept Wolfram-side. The Schur blocks are fixed permutations of the same tensors; one export
serves both routes. `z_degree` (residue path) is exported as Stage-1 metadata or probed at
random coupling points, with the non-generic-point failure mode documented.

> **Amendment (coherence pass, 2026-09-04 — #522).** This paragraph previously read
> *"PSALTer **guarantees** linearity in the couplings, so each block is …"*. It does not.
> `NonLinearCouplings` is declared but never thrown and `EnsureLinearInCouplings` is an
> internal null-vector helper, not a validator — a bare `−¼F²` passes silently.
>
> The **architecture is unchanged**: linearity of the wave operator in the couplings is a
> *mathematical consequence* of a Lagrangian linear in them, since `ConstructWaveOperator`
> is linear in its input. What moved is **who owns the property** — from "guaranteed
> upstream" to "enforced by us". The enforcement is our config-layer validator
> (`stage1_engineering_plan.md` §4.1) plus the in-kernel reconstruction `SameQ` (§5).
>
> **Consequence for an implementer: that validator is load-bearing for correctness, not a
> convenience.** A non-linear coupling slipping through does not raise — it yields a wrong
> `A[n,i]` decomposition and therefore a wrong wave operator, silently. On whether `A[n,0]`
> may legitimately be non-zero, see the matching amendment in `stage1_engineering_plan.md` §5.

### 6.2 The massless sector

> **Amendment (scientific review, 2026-09-06 — supervisor intel, Barker).** This section
> repeatedly says the numerical massless analysis is "implemented numerically nowhere",
> which reads as *we must invent the algorithm*. **That is not the situation.** Barker's
> account: the massless analysis was omitted from the published supplementary material
> **for convenience — TorC was not interested in massless particles — not because it is
> difficult**, and the **general algorithm is well understood** in the literature.
>
> So "implemented nowhere" is scoped to *the released code*, and L4 is a
> **find-and-implement** task, not a research task: locate the published treatments of the
> massless spectrum, curate them into `docs/references.md`, and implement the *complete*
> algorithm — the same learn-from-Barker-then-go-to-the-literature pattern the Schur
> criterion (§5) already follows. **A literature search is therefore a deliverable of the
> Stage-2 handoff, and precedes implementation.** This lowers L4's assessed risk
> accordingly; ask Barker for the specific references he has in mind (agenda item,
> `docs/meetings/2026-09-11_supervisor.md`).


The paper's license for skipping it (arXiv:2606.30785 §implementation ¶"Mass spectra"): the
massless case needs "a full component decomposition" (little-group change), and "additional
radiative degrees of freedom are excluded by the thermal history" — footnoted as holding only
"for populated species in thermal equilibrium". Sound for their models (their targets are new
*massive* particles; `TDiff` is massive gravity with no massless graviton at all). **Inverted
for us**: the massless graviton and photon are the carriers of every observable this program
targets, their health is coupling-dependent (TorC's `(ν+2μ)(ν−μ) > 0` *is* a massless residue
condition), and the released health guards (`|Re m| > 0.01` in JAX, `abs(k) > TOL` in Julia)
would reject GR+Maxwell — they are scope guards implementing the license, not health criteria,
and no massless pole may ever reach them.

Four layers, by cost:

- **L1 — massive spectrum, per sample**: primary = Schur (§5); residue route as cross-check.
- **L2 — massless counting, essentially free, per sample**: under Schur, the structurally
  massless modes are the `O_LL` block by construction, and a massive mode *becoming* massless
  is a zero eigenvalue of `−K_J⁻¹M_J`; under the residue route, the multiplicity of `z = 0`
  sits in the det coefficients (`c₀ = det M₀`). Compared against the Stage-1-declared content.
- **L3 — massless health, compiled closed form**: Stage 1's massless analysis
  (`MaxLaurentDepth→1`) exports `UnitarityConditions` including the massless residue
  conditions (TorC's third condition; EC's `c₁ < 0`); compile to a per-sample boolean. Partial
  for our theory class (§5.1) — present for the graviton-type conditions, absent where PSALTer
  halts.
- **L4 — numerical massless residue, fallback and cross-check** (2406.09500 §MasslessSpectrum,
  eqs. `MatrixEquation`→`TotalNoGhost`, implemented numerically nowhere **in the released
  code — see the amendment below; the algorithm itself is standard**): constraint matrix
  `C(En, Mo)` → right null vectors with the `(E−p)^{μ_b}` spurious-pole guard → reduced
  Hermitian `Π_red = ξ†O⁺ξ` (Moore–Penrose by SVD — expensive symbolically, cheap
  numerically) → residue at `E→p` by extrapolation in `E` at fixed `p` (the direct analogue of
  the released Vandermonde det-coefficient trick) → Hermitian eigendecomposition →
  `λ_c > 0 ∀c`, polarization count = number of non-zero `λ_c`. The paper notes the `λ_c` are
  rational in `p²`, which obfuscates *symbolic* conditions; numerically it does not — evaluate
  at 2–3 values of `p` and require sign agreement.

L3 when present; L4 is what keeps the module general (closed forms provably do not always
exist — Abel–Ruffini, and `TensorTheory`'s "(Demonstrably impossible)"). L3 ↔ L4 agreement is
a validation gate. **Extra** massless poles beyond the declared content are *flagged and
routed to the program's `ΔN_eff ≲ 0.1` validity check* (`docs/COSMOLOGY_PROGRAM.md` §"Validity
enforcement"; Domcke & Garcia-Cely arXiv:2006.01161, local), not auto-rejected — footnote 8's
thermalization caveat is precisely the loophole a weakly-coupled spectator sector lives in. A
count *below* declared content means the structure changed and compiled L3 conditions no
longer apply: a loud finding, never a score.

## 7. Stage 2, step by step, with sources

`pub` = `SupplementalMaterials-2607/JAX/src/psalter/`; `jl` = `Julia/src/run/evaluator/`.
Rows 2–8 are the **residue route** — the cross-check path; the primary path (reorder → Schur →
`K_J` definiteness → `−K_J⁻¹M_J` eigenvalues) is §5 and has no published code to cite. Rows 1
and 9–12 apply to both routes.

## 8. Why the released code drops gauge sectors — worked from the published files

`_z_degree` computes `det M(k)` symbolically over the coupling symbols; returning `-1` means
the determinant vanishes identically in `k` *and* the couplings — a gauge symmetry acting
inside the sector — and the evaluator skips the sector. Decoding the published
`ParticleSpectrographVectorTheory.wxf` (general vector theory
`L = −½Θ₁∂_aA_b∂^aA^b + ½Θ₂(∂·A)² − ½Θ₃A²`) gives two 1×1 blocks, verbatim:

```text
0+ :  ½[ k²(Θ₂ − Θ₁) − Θ₃ ]
1- :  ½[ −k²Θ₁ − Θ₃ ]
```

Maxwell is the locus `Θ₁ = Θ₂, Θ₃ = 0` (that combination is `−¼F²` up to a total derivative):
the `0⁺` block vanishes identically → sector skipped; the `1⁻` root moves to `z = 0` → a
massless pole the scope guard discards. **Maxwell hits both failure modes at once.** The paper
itself analyzes this point — as a *destination*: its technical-naturalness trajectories
"terminate in the massless limit Θ₃ = 0 … the emergent symmetry is that of Maxwell theory",
where "two out of three vector polarizations survive" (2606.30785:515 and footnote). For them
a measure-zero boundary reached by steepest descent; **we live on that surface**.

Answers to the natural objections:

- *Is skipping harmful for pure EM?* No — Maxwell's `0⁺` sector is entirely pure gauge;
  skipping it is correct. The damage is confined to **mixed** sectors holding a gauge
  direction *and* physical states — and in PGT+EM the `0⁺` block is indexed by all fields'
  `0⁺` states at once, so one U(1) null direction throws away every torsion scalar in the
  block. TorC counts 15 (ECT) to 21 (PGT) gauge generators; scalar-EC counts 10.
- *Do new couplings fix it?* Not if they are gauge-invariant — built from `F`, curvature and
  torsion covariants, they enforce the degeneracy structurally at every coupling value. Only a
  symmetry-*breaking* term (a bare `A_μ`, a photon mass) lifts it — the deferred `cs1`–`cs3`
  case, where the newly visible mode's health is exactly what wants checking.
- *Both pipelines?* Split by issue. **Gauge degeneracy**: a problem only for the untuned JAX
  code; the tuned Julia code handles it (row 9), and the Schur route relocates it to Stage 1.
  **Massless health**: computed numerically by *neither* — both guard massless poles out; that
  is the genuinely missing piece §6.2 supplies.
- *So the problem is inherently that our theories are tuned?* **Yes — that is the one-sentence
  version.** The released fast path assumes genericity; gauge-invariant theories are maximally
  non-generic; §§4–6 are the response to that single fact.

Two failure modes, both handled: **structural** degeneracy (identical in couplings — fixed
rank, fixed-shape projectors, §9) and **accidental** degeneracy at special coupling points
(numerically singular only — detect and flag, never silently absorb).

### 8.1 Deforming off the symmetric locus — a capability, not the default

Since §4.1 gives every operator its own coupling, the symmetric locus is one point of our
parameter space, and the framework explicitly endorses expanding a symmetric model into the
surrounding non-symmetric space — one-way, with small, technically natural breaking couplings
(2606.30785:343, 345). A deformed theory (`Θ₃ ≠ 0`) is generic: the released residue code
works as-is and the massless problem softens. It cannot *replace* proper gauge handling, for
two concrete reasons: the symmetric limit is **discontinuous and branch-dependent** (the
paper's own footnote: the transverse branch's `Θ₃ = Θ₁ = 0` limit "propagates *nothing*",
unlike the Proca branch's surviving two polarizations; for gravity this is vDVZ), so a
deformed verdict is not automatically a verdict about the gauge-invariant theory; and it
trades a structural zero for an **ill-conditioned near-zero** — tolerance-based rank
identification, the ill-posed regime documented in this project's #473/#477 arc. Use
deformation as: a continuity diagnostic (sweep the breaking coupling → 0 against the
gauge-handled answer), a discontinuity detector (a vDVZ-type finding, not a bug), and a
bootstrap (early verdicts flagged `deformed`, never presented as verdicts about the symmetric
theory). Deformation changes the *theory*; Schur changes the *algorithm* — independent
mitigations, and deformation keeps its diagnostic value under either.

## 9. Performance

Anchors: the polology paper's tuned surveys — the corner-plot figures — ran at "a walltime of
minutes on a single CPU core at double precision" with `10⁴` live points
(§implementation-appendix ¶Platforms footnote), putting per-evaluation at µs–ms; the released
`sample.py` reports refine cost in ms/row. Those are small theories — the figure anchors the
scale, not a promise for PGT+EM-sized blocks.

- **Compile-once, per structure**: coefficient tensors; the reordering permutation and block
  shapes (Schur); det kernels and root finders (residue route); gauge null-space structure;
  constraint null vectors; JIT compile.
- **Per sample, primary (Schur)**: tensordot for the blocks; per sector one small inverse, two
  products, a Cholesky definiteness test, one small eigenproblem.
- **Per sample, residue cross-check**: det evaluations + Vandermonde solve + roots + one SVD
  per root — on demand, not in the survey hot loop.
- **Per sample, L4**: one pseudoinverse of the component-basis operator (~38–44² for PGT+EM)
  at a few `E` nodes.

**The rule that protects the budget: every rank and shape decision is made once per structure,
never per sample.** The Julia reference must not be copied verbatim here — it calls
`find_gauge_modes` per sample with tolerance-based rank determination, data-dependent shapes
that `jax.jit`/`vmap` cannot take. Structural gauge symmetries are coupling-independent
(verified: TDiff's exported source constraints contain no couplings), so the rank is fixed at
a generic coupling point at compile time; accidental degeneracies are detected and flagged.
The Julia `evaluator.jl` early-return shape (nothing computed for sick samples beyond the
verdict) is adopted; its internals are not.

**Threshold, written down before coding:** median per-sample verdict **≤ 1 ms** on the
`torsion_gertsenshtein`-family sector matrices (roster per §2) at fp64 on one CPU core;
compile time reported separately.

## 10. Design decisions (consolidated)

1. **Two-stage split** (§1); Stage 1 unmodified PSALTer driven from outside; Stage 2 all-JAX.
2. **Ecosystem-native conventions per branch**; no conversion layer anywhere (§4).
3. **Coupling-per-operator input contract; reject, never auto-assign** (§4.1).
4. **Bare `h = g − η`**, no rescaling, spectrum branch (§4.2).
5. **Primary ghost/tachyon algorithm: Schur-complement kinetic matrix; residue route as
   permanent cross-check** (§5). Redundant computation is a design principle wherever two
   published algorithms exist for one quantity (Schur/residue, L3/L4, deformed/gauge-handled)
   — the only affordable substitute for a reference implementation that mostly does not exist.
6. **One evaluator, two outputs**: hard verdict and smooth `log L` from the same Schur
   quantities — the manuscript's `U`/compression applied to the eigenvalues of `−K_J` (ghost
   margin) and `−K_J⁻¹M_J` (tachyon margin) — never `U` wired to residues while the verdict
   reads `K_J` (`feedback_shared_stage_not_copied_stage`).
7. **Explicit `J^P` labels per state**; position is never a label (§6.1).
8. **Massless layers L2/L3/L4** with declared-content assertion; extra massless poles routed
   to the `ΔN_eff` flag (§6.2).
9. **Fixed shapes per structure** (§9).
10. **Gate-only v1**: mass dimensions and emergent symmetries explicitly deferred, extension
    point named (§3.1).
11. **Verdict payload** follows the project's honest-flag convention — *(amended
    2026-09-06: this pointed at `gauge_certificate`, which `repo_reshape.md` §5.3 **drops**
    as an artifact of the halted symbolic-gauge arc (#477). The surviving convention is the
    shared **flagged-rejection** mechanism owned by `tidalcosmo/validity/` and defined at
    M1a; follow that.)* — per-state
    `J^P`, masses, `K_J` spectra, health, massless count vs declared content,
    `massless_sector` provenance (`compiled`/`numerical`/`not-assessed`),
    `extra_massless_poles` (→ `ΔN_eff` flag), `ghost_method` (`schur-kinetic`/`residue`),
    parity-odd support state, `k4_guard`, tolerances.
12. **One-directional dependency**; provenance docstrings; license handled as a release
    blocker on #495 (§3).

**Rework list against the released code:** (1) gauge sectors silently dropped (§8) — large on
the residue route, relocated to Stage 1 on the Schur route; (2) massless poles scored as sick
(§6.2); (3) positional spin labels (§6.1) — now demonstrated wrong on the release's own
`A23Theory` fixture; (4) the `k⁴` degree assertion — kept as a guard; the roster excludes
curvature-squared terms (§2).

## 11. Integration points

- **Screen before compute**: sick points never reach the solver.
- **`run_status` tagging in inference**: this is #360's Approach D, recorded in
  `docs/V3_2_DESIGN_INVESTIGATION.md:36` as "the ultimate goal", deferred only because
  "PSALTer integration is non-trivial". This workstream expires that deferral.
- **Soft prior designed in, not wired now**: the smooth `log L` (decision 6) composes with the
  joint-prior surface (`tidal/inference/_prior.py::RadialAngularPrior` / `parse_joint_prior`),
  which D9 schedules for re-implementation as a Cobaya component. Under a hard gate,
  positivity is imposed by fiat and invisible in the posterior; under the soft/tagged form it
  emerges as a learned constraint, and `D_KL` quantifies how much the data vs the unitarity
  likelihood contributes — a result, not plumbing.
- **Validity flags**: `extra_massless_poles` feeds the program's spectator-validity
  enforcement (`ΔN_eff`); the verdict payload joins the shared flagged-rejection family
  (`validity/`, defined at M1a — **not** the dropped `gauge_certificate`) in the honest-flags
  family.

## 12. Validation set

| | check | tolerance / criterion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| (a) | **Lin–Hobson–Lasenby / TIDAL inequalities** — the WS6 gate. `docs/tex/pgt_stability_priors.tex` §"TIDAL conventions", `examples/torsion_gertsenshtein/theory_nonminimal.toml:91-97`: tensor `q²` (2⁻) `β₁+β₂ < −½/κ²`; axial `S²` (1⁺) `β₁−β₂ > +¼/κ²`; trace `T²` (1⁻) `β₃+(2β₁+β₂)/3 < 4/(3κ²)`. Working point `(0, −0.6, 0.5)`, recorded margins `−0.1, −0.058, −1.033` | reproduce each margin's **sign** at the working point; locate each boundary by 1-D scan to `10⁻⁶` relative. Sectors `2⁻/1⁺/1⁻` exercise the `J^P` labeling |
| (b) | **Against the published implementations, one per half**: kernel-level vs JAX on the committed WXF fixtures (`VectorTheory`, `TensorTheory`, `S123Theory`, `A23Theory`, `TDiffTheory`, `FierzPauliTheory`); pipeline-level vs the committed Julia `*_unitarity_NS` chains (`FierzPauli`, `FierzPauliProca`, `TDiff`, `Vector`) — no Wolfram or Julia run needed | masses/residues ≤ `10⁻¹⁰` relative (fp64, shared non-degenerate sectors); healthy-region agreement statistical vs chains |
| (c) | **TorC** — primary `ParticleSpectrographTorCECT` (our formulation; 15 gauge generators), `…TorCPGT` (21) secondary; caption at `paper_Qtorsion.tex:656` | pseudoscalar `0⁻`, `m = √λ`; `λ ≥ 0` and `μ < 0` (L1); massless `(ν+2μ)(ν−μ) > 0` (L3, L4 cross-check); 2 massless polarizations (L2); gauge counts from Stage 1 |
| (d) | **GR + Maxwell healthy** — declared massless content `2+2`, no spurious sick verdict | exact; catches rework item 2 and exercises the gauge path where the answer is known by hand |
| (e) | **Cross-branch reconciliation** (restricted limit): solver branch on Minkowski, background block off; vary the spectrum branch's quadratic Lagrangian and match the solver EOM up to the §4.3 dictionary, comparing gauge-invariant quantities (effective signs per `.claude/rules/wolfram.md`) | exact symbolic match of effective signs |
| (f) | **Performance** | median verdict ≤ 1 ms (§9) |
| (g) | **Schur route vs its oracles** (§5.1): `ScalarParityViolatingPGT` intermediate blocks, `K₀`, `M₀`, `c₅ > 0 ∧ 4c₃c₅ − c₄² > 0`, eq. `no_tachyon_cond_3`, `c₁ < 0`, 10 gauge generators; `app:PGT_comparison` (Karananas masses, Blagojević no-tachyon, empty massless spin-one); **and** Schur ↔ residue agreement everywhere both are valid — proven equivalent, so disagreement localizes a bug | matrices to `10⁻¹²` after convention alignment; verdicts exact |

Plus, from §8.1: the deformed → symmetric Maxwell limit reproduces the paper's own statement
(Proca branch: two of three polarizations survive; transverse branch at `Θ₃ = Θ₁ = 0`
propagates nothing).

## 13. Stage 1 as its own workstream — EXECUTED by H8 (2026-09-04)


> **Amendment (H8 execution, 2026-09-04 — verified against PSALTer v2.0.2 @ `bb45adb0`).**
> **§13 has been executed** — H8 studied it and produced `docs/cosmology/stage1_engineering_plan.md`.
> Five statements in this section are corrected by that study:
>
> - **`Method→"Hard"` is a dead option** — declared in `Options`, never read anywhere in the
>   package (**#521**). Its cost is not a go/no-go for anything; the measurement to make is
>   plain `ParticleSpectrum` wall time.
> - **"the WXF slots come from PSALTer itself" is inverted** — PSALTer **writes no WXF** and
>   populates only two association keys (`WaveOperator`, `PseudoDeterminant`). The committed
>   `.wxf` files came from separate curation tooling. The exporter's real harvest surface is
>   those two keys plus eight `xAct`PSALTer`Private`` `$Local*` globals (**#523**) — which
>   makes the pinned commit a *correctness* input, not merely a reproducibility one.
> - **"the install settles the missing-coupling failure behavior"** — already answered:
>   there is none. `NonLinearCouplings` is never thrown (**#522**), so the live probe only
>   confirms the silence and harvests wording.
> - **Inkscape is effectively unused** (every `Vectorize` call site is commented out), and
>   **Wolfram 14.3 + xAct are installed and activated** — only PSALTer itself is not.
> - **Single-session substitution-rule linearization is Barker's own proven pattern**
>   (`PoincareGaugeTheory.m` + `Linearise.m`), replacing the two-session route assumed here.

This document specifies the Stage-1 → Stage-2 **contract**: labeled `J^P` blocks as
coupling-linear coefficient tensors; gauge ranks and the massive/massless partition; the
source-constraint matrix; declared massless content; closed-form conditions when PSALTer
resolves them; scope-guard metadata. The Wolfram engineering behind that contract deserves its
own session:

- **Install PSALTer** (Mathematica 14+/xAct/Inkscape; the SupplementalMaterials repo carries
  `third_party/WolframEngine_14.3.0_LIN.sh`). Only xAct is installed today. The install also
  settles the open items needing a live session: the exact `WaveOperator` label metadata, the
  missing-coupling failure behavior, `Method→"Hard"` cost on a PGT+EM theory (currently
  unmeasured — record, do not guess).
- The **spectrum derivation branch** (§4.5) and the auto-generated model/export script (§4.4,
  §4.5), with the enumerated-symmetry validation and the coupling-per-operator contract.
- **Our own Wolfram-side exporter** reaching into PSALTer's result objects to emit the
  contract above. The published `JuliaExport.m` shows the pattern but emits `.jl` source; the
  WXF slots do **not** come from PSALTer itself (see the §13 amendment above — #523); the
  coefficient-tensor and explicit-label export exists
  nowhere and must be written.

**We do not modify PSALTer** — integration means generating its input and harvesting its
output from outside. The division: H8 owns Stage-1 Wolfram engineering (coordinated with M3's
`derive/` port, whose "port and substantial extension" scope in H4 §5.4 the spectrum branch
extends); WS6 proper owns the Stage-2 numerics at `tidalcosmo/spectrum/`, built at M∥ per H4's
migration order (Schur, residue cross-check, verdict/likelihood surface); both build against
this document.

## 14. Open items and risks

1. **`ParticleSpectrum` wall time on PGT+EM** — unmeasured; TorC's spectrographs prove
   feasibility. (→ H8.) ***Amendment (H8, 2026-09-04 — verified against PSALTer v2.0.2 @ `bb45adb0`):*** the risk stands,
   but **not as a `Method` comparison** — the option is inert at that revision (#521, §4.5
   amendment). The number to report is the wall time of the call itself, with per-stage
   checkpoints; protocol in `stage1_engineering_plan.md` §6.
2. **Exact `WaveOperator` labeling metadata** — the `J`-block structure is established
   (§6.1), but the per-state ordering convention should be confirmed against a live PSALTer
   and the field-kinematics tables before the exporter hardcodes it. (→ H8.) ***Amendment (H8, 2026-09-04 — verified against PSALTer v2.0.2 @ `bb45adb0`):***
   the harvest surface is now identified (§6.1 amendment) and the labels are read from the
   SPO/field-kinematics tables; the open part is narrowed to **calibrating** the convention
   against single-operator theories of known block occupancy, per
   `stage1_engineering_plan.md` §5.
3. **Chequer-Hermitian sign conventions** — pinned only up to the `i`-vs-skew-symmetric
   freedom noted in `app:PGT_comparison`; must be fixed against the `K₀` oracle before the
   definiteness test ships. (→ WS6, validation (g).)
4. **`O_LL` conditioning away from strict masslessness** — the Schur complement needs an
   invertible `O_LL`; near-degenerate cases fall into the accidental-degeneracy flag path, but
   the threshold policy needs setting during implementation.
5. **PSALTer's closed-form coverage (L3) is partial for our class** — established (§5.1);
   L4's implementation priority follows from how often L3 comes back unresolved on the actual
   roster.
6. **License resolution before any public release** — #495, options ranked in §3.
7. **The `ΔN_eff` routing** for extra massless poles assumes the program's validity-flag
   machinery (WS2+) exists to receive it; until then the flag is recorded but nothing consumes
   it.
