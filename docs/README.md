# Documentation Directory

This directory contains three kinds of document:

- **`docs/cosmology/`** — the **active program**: the Cobaya-extension direction (umbrella #488). Start at `COSMOLOGY_PROGRAM.md`.
- **`docs/tex/`** — living technical documentation in LaTeX, for inclusion in the project's Overleaf report. It describes the **legacy** `tidal/` pipeline, which still exists and still runs; it is accurate, not stale.
- **Markdown files** — project management: roadmaps, trackers, campaign records. Most of the roadmap material is **parked** under the 2026-08-29 pivot; each carries an amendment banner saying so.

## Cosmology Program (`docs/cosmology/`) — ACTIVE

The current direction (pivot 2026-08-29): a **Cobaya extension** evolving a new sector's
linear perturbations as **spectators** on a CAMB LCDM background, producing CMB observables
and real likelihoods. Umbrella **#488**.

**Read `COSMOLOGY_PROGRAM.md` first** — it carries the decisions register, the observable
ladder, the workstreams and the current state. The rest are the research records behind it,
produced by eight sequential handoff sessions (H1–H8).

| File | Content |
| ---- | ------- |
| `../COSMOLOGY_PROGRAM.md` | **The operational record.** Decisions D1–D9, observable ladder O0–O4, workstreams WS0–WS6, verification gates. Start here |
| `primer.md` | Physics orientation: what a Boltzmann code does, what a spectator field is, why this route works |
| `spectator_route.md` | H7 — the three conditions a spectator sector must satisfy, and what breaks if one fails |
| `torc_pipeline_audit.md` | H1 — audit of TorC (arXiv:2507.09228), the predecessor this program is framed against. Settles O1's scope (R1) and how the CAMB patch is made (R2) |
| `observable_ladder.md` | H2 — per-rung feasibility: capabilities, known-answer targets, costs, risks. Establishes that O2 and O3 are **different numerical problems** |
| `magnetic_field_background.md` | H2 — the primordial B-field model O3 needs, and the spectator condition no paper enforces on it |
| `solver_design.md` | H3 — two engines over one shared core; the integration-target decision (option iii); the O2 ladder, matrix-WKB design, benchmark protocol |
| `repo_reshape.md` | H4 — the strangler-fig migration: `tidalcosmo/` beside legacy `tidal/`, the capability ledger, milestones M0–M7, CI and oracle strategy |
| `spectrum_design.md` | H6 — the two-stage spectrum architecture; Schur-complement kinetic-matrix criterion (arXiv:2506.02111) as the primary algorithm |
| `stage1_engineering_plan.md` | H8 — Stage-1 engineering **study**: six live-source findings correcting H6 (#521, #522, #523) |
| `birefringence_notes.md` | O4 foundation: rotation formulae, the per-operator frequency-scaling problem, likelihood options |
| `scientific_review.md` | **The pre-implementation review (2026-09-06).** Per-rung verdicts, a 40-finding disposition ledger, the ranked risk register, and the interfaces that must be defined before their consumers are built |
| `planning_session_record.md` | Archived planning transcript. **Not authoritative** — kept for provenance only |
| `handoffs/H1–H6, H8.md` | The prompts each session was given. All complete; each carries a status header. Kept as the record of *what was asked* |

## LaTeX Documentation (`docs/tex/`)

All technical documentation lives in `docs/tex/` as LaTeX fragments. Each file is self-contained (no `\documentclass`), starts with `\section{Title}\label{sec:slug}`, and uses macros from `preamble.tex`. These `.tex` files are the primary documentation — update them directly. To compile any fragment standalone:

```latex
\documentclass[11pt,a4paper]{article}
\input{preamble}
\begin{document}
\input{fragment_name}
\bibliographystyle{unsrt}
\bibliography{references}
\end{document}
```
