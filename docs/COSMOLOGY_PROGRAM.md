# TIDAL → Cosmology Program

**Status:** ACTIVE (program started 2026-08-29, after supervisor meeting 2026-08-28)
**Tracking:** umbrella #488 · WS0 #489 · WS1 #490 · WS2 #491 · WS3 #492 · WS4 #493 ·

**Orchestration:** one orchestrator session holds this document current; workstream
sessions are dispatched by the user from the prompts in `docs/cosmology/handoffs/`.

**Companion documents** — this file is the *operational* record (decisions, ladder,
workstreams, gates). The physics lives alongside it:

| Document | Covers |
|---|---|
| `docs/cosmology/primer.md` | How a CMB pipeline computes `C_ℓ`, the two levels (background vs perturbations), what we reuse vs build, why an in-house solver, what a Cobaya `Theory` class is, the `a(η)` symbolic-vs-tabulated resolution. **Read first if new to the program.** |

## Goal

Integrate a candidate Lagrangian's perturbations over the history of an expanding
universe, produce CMB observables, and do genuine Bayesian inference against measured
data — packaged as a **Cobaya extension** so others can test their own Lagrangians
against real likelihoods. This replaces the prior mode of work (coupling-space surveys on
flat Minkowski scored against synthetic objectives).

## The brief, decoded

The direct predecessor is the group's own paper, local at `literature/2507.09228/`:
**Legner, Handley & Barker, "Alleviating the Hubble tension with Torsion Condensation
(TorC)"** — stack: PSALTer particle spectrum → modified CAMB → Cobaya → PolyChord,
against Planck 2018 + SH0ES. It states exactly the limitation this program lifts:

> "this analysis modifies the background expansion in CAMB … while the perturbation
> equations remain those of standard ΛCDM" … "cosmological perturbation theory for TorC
> will be developed in future work."

Public assets from that work (all verified 2026-08-29):

- `ModifiedCAMB` → <https://github.com/slegner/CAMB> (fork of `cmbant/CAMB`; reads
  tabulated `ρ_Λ(a)`, `P_Λ(a)` — the `w(a)` interface develops poles when `ρ_Λ` changes
  sign)
- `ModifiedCobaya` → <https://github.com/slegner/cobaya> (forked via
  `AdamOrmondroyd/cobaya`)
- Chains/supplementary → doi:10.5281/zenodo.15866507

TorC used the **symbolic** Wolfram PSALTer (arXiv:2406.09500 + 2506.02111) — sufficient
for one theory analyzed once. Sampling arbitrary Lagrangians needs the **numerical**
polology route (arXiv:2606.30785): "symbolic computation scales poorly due to expression
swell; the only avenue is numerical" — confirmed verbatim by supervisor Barker in the
meeting.

## Central architecture: the spectator (test-field) route

**The background is always the established ΛCDM one, supplied by CAMB. The new sector's
perturbations are evolved on top of it as test fields, and their observable imprints (on
gravitons, photons, polarization, lensing) are what we compare to data.**

The spectator limit means: **(a)** the new sector does not affect the background
expansion (negligible in the Friedmann equation); **(b)** it does not gravitationally
disturb the standard perturbations (negligible in the Einstein constraints); **(c)**
everything stays linear. Two clarifications:

- "Standard perturbations don't back-react on the background" is standard first-order
  cosmological perturbation theory (`δρ/ρ ~ 10⁻⁵`), used by everyone — not our
  assumption. Our *additional* assumption is (a)+(b) for the **new** sector only.
- We *do* modify the propagation of standard quanta (photons, gravitons) — through the
  **explicit coupling terms in the Lagrangian** (torsion–photon, torsion–graviton
  mixing), kept at linear order. Condition (b) forbids only *gravitational* sourcing via
  the new sector's stress-energy. Coupling-mediated ≠ gravity-mediated; the former is the
  entire point.

The consistency of coupling-without-backreaction is a clean double expansion (stated
verbatim in Cembranos et al., arXiv:2302.08186, local): order 0 in perturbations →
background equations, discarded and replaced by CAMB's solution (the only place the
spectator assumption enters); order 1 → tadpoles, vanish on-shell; order 2 → the full
quadratic action *including all mixing terms*, kept whole.

### Reachable observables (and the boundary)

1. **Propagation (reachable):** standard quanta travel through the new sector's
   background/couplings, altering speed, phase, damping, polarization — no energy moves.
   Birefringence, modified GW friction/dispersion.
2. **Conversion (reachable):** quanta oscillate between sectors (Gertsenshtein
   graviton↔photon), moving a small energy fraction — CMB spectral distortion, V-modes,
   radio excess. The tiny converted fraction *is* the measurement.
3. **Gravitational sourcing (NOT reachable in the strict limit):** the new sector's
   `δρ, σ` in the Einstein constraints creating anisotropy the way CDM does — that is
   dropping assumption (b), the axionCAMB-style full-component route. A deliberate later
   extension, never silently blended in.

### Validity enforcement (supervisor-flagged; first-class requirement)

The literature asserts spectator validity in one sentence and never enforces it.
We enforce it numerically, per run (honest-flags style, like `gauge_certificate`):

- `ρ_new/ρ_γ` against the `ΔN_eff ≲ 0.1` bound (Domcke & Garcia-Cely arXiv:2006.01161,
  local);
- conversion probability `P_max ≪ 1`;
- amplitudes `|h| ≪ 1` and `|f| ≪ |F̄|` *(amended 2026-09-06: this read `|h|, |f| ≪ 1`.
  `f` is a field-strength perturbation, so `|f| ≪ 1` is not dimensionally meaningful —
  the criterion in the source, `spectator_route.md` §2, is that it be small **relative
  to the background field** `F̄`)*;
- **growth-impact monitor**: per mode, the ratio of new-sector to standard-sector source
  terms in the Einstein constraints — "would these perturbations have affected the growth
  we froze?"

**Silent-failure risk to check:** the CAMB background solves *Einstein's* equations; our
quadratic action is PGT. Consistency requires the PGT background field equations be
satisfied by (FRW, `T̄ = 0` or tracking torsion) to needed accuracy — see
`literature/2003.02690/` for the tracking/frozen solutions. The check is a
**background-EOM residual** on the CAMB background, designed fresh for the new
architecture (the concept is proven by the #477 work; its code is not carried over).

### Division of labor per likelihood call

| Computed by | What | Recomputes when |
|---|---|---|
| **CAMB (unchanged)** | ΛCDM background `a(η)`, `H(η)`; thermal history `x_e(η)`, `g(η)`; all standard-sector perturbations; standard `C_ℓ`, lensing, matter power | ΛCDM params move (slow block; cached otherwise) |
| **Our solver** | **the coupled block**: new-sector modes `δT(k,η)` *plus the standard modes they directly couple to* (tensor `h`; photon polarization) — small per-`k` linear ODE system, coefficients involving CAMB's `a(η)`, `H(η)` | new-sector coupling moves (fast block) |
| **Nobody** | nothing ΛCDM is re-derived or re-solved by us — ever | — |

No existing package can evolve *our* equations — CAMB/CLASS hard-code the ΛCDM species.
The one genuinely new numerical task (small, k-parametrized, time-dependent-coefficient
linear systems) is TIDAL's existing modal competence generalized to `M = M(η)`.

**Worked chain (tensor channel):** primordial `A_t, n_t` → per-`k` integration of the
coupled `(h, torsion)` system over `η` with CAMB's `a(η)` → transfer function →
line-of-sight projection `Δ_ℓ(k) = ∫dη S(k,η) j_ℓ(k(η₀−η))` →
`C_ℓ^BB = 4π∫(dk/k) Δ²_t(k)|Δ_ℓ(k)|²` → BICEP/Keck/LiteBIRD likelihood. Photon channel
analogous: accumulated rotation/conversion applied to CAMB's `C_ℓ` → EB/V data.

**`a(η)` handling:** derive the equations **symbolically with `a(η)`, `H(η)` as
unspecified background functions** (once per theory — this is how expansion enters:
Hubble-friction `∝ H`, `a²`-dependent masses); evaluate coefficients numerically from
CAMB's table at solve time (per call). Analytic-metric mode retained for validation cases
(de Sitter). **Working time variable: conformal time `η`** (CAMB's internal variable);
`t ↔ η ↔ z` conversions at the CAMB interface.

**Cobaya integration:** our component is a `Theory` class (Cobaya's pluggable prediction
component: `get_requirements()` / `calculate()` / `get_X()`), chaining off CAMB
(`{"CAMBdata": None}` → `provider.get_CAMBdata()`), returning either replaced transfer
functions or conversions/rotations applied to CAMB output. Downstream likelihoods see
standard products. Packaging is plain dotted-path import (no entry points); template:
`simonsobs/cosmopower_cobaya`. Fast/slow blocking with **dragging** (large speed
hierarchy: ΛCDM params trigger CAMB, coupling params trigger only our ODE).

**CAMB policy:** target **latest upstream CAMB** by default. The tabulated-background
feature is an *optional hook*, off by default. **Settled by H1 (§7, decision R2, GH #498):
re-apply the patch ourselves on our own fork off the upstream `2.0.3` tag — do not inherit
`slegner/CAMB`.** That fork is 180 commits behind upstream, carries unrelated post-paper
work, a breaking public-signature change, a debug `print *`, and a stray settings file;
pinning it would also contradict the latest-upstream policy. Upstream's own
`set_w_a_table` is not an alternative — it is the pole-prone route the paper had to avoid.
The patch itself is small: one optional `P` output on `BackgroundDensityAndPressure` so
pressure comes from a spline instead of being rebuilt as `w·ρ`; the rest of the fork's
file count is signature churn from that one argument.

## Decisions register

Every decision settled anywhere in the program, in one place. Today "what has been decided?"
otherwise means reading ~6,500 lines across eleven documents — nothing is wrong with any of
them, there was simply no index.

| Ref | What was settled | By / when | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D1–D9** | Program-level direction — see the table below | user, 2026-08-29 | this document |
| **Rung order** | `O0 → O1 → O2 → O4a → O3 → O4b/V-modes`. Technically neutral, so a pure scientific-priority call. **Gated on #503**: O4a is only cheap if the operator is `n = 0` and `β` is constant over recombination | user, 2026-09-04 (H2 recommended) | §Rung order, `observable_ladder.md` §5 |
| **Integration target** | **Option (iii)** — our own coupled-block solver chained to **unmodified** CAMB. Patching CAMB's Fortran and building on DISCO-EB both rejected; learn from DISCO-EB, never copy its code (#516 closed) | H3, 2026-08-31 | `solver_design.md` §6 |
| **Two solver kinds** | O2 needs an oscillation-resolving mode-equation solver (`~1–10³` oscillations); O3 needs an eikonal amplitude engine with coherence-patch averaging (**`~10²⁹`** — not steppable). **Two engines, one shared core** | H2 → H3, 2026-08-30/31 | `observable_ladder.md` §0.1, `solver_design.md` §7 |
| **Binding cost** | `η`-grid **assembly**, not the matrix exponential (#518). Optimize there first | H3, 2026-08-31 | `solver_design.md` §1 |
| **Stepper choice** | By **bake-off**, not a priori — every candidate implemented and trialed against the §10 protocol | H3, 2026-08-31 | `solver_design.md` §11 |
| **R1 — O1 scope** | O1 is a **fixed-table pass-through plumbing gate**, not a TorC reproduction. Full posterior reproduction (O1b) rejected for now — a nested-sampling campaign for a plumbing check, with the nonlinear TorC background inside the fast block | H1, 2026-08-30 | `torc_pipeline_audit.md` §R1 |
| **R2 — CAMB patch** | **Re-apply cleanly** off upstream `2.0.3`, own fork. Never inherit `slegner/CAMB` (180 commits behind, breaks a public signature); upstream's own `set_w_a_table` is the pole-prone route the paper abandoned | H1, 2026-08-30 | `torc_pipeline_audit.md` §7 |
| **O1 gate** | Constant table `P = −ρ` → ΛCDM `C_ℓ` to machine precision; `TorC_rhopa.py` table → reference `H(a)`/`C_ℓ`; plus the free `set_w_a_table` cross-check at `ϖ_r = 0.8` | H1, 2026-08-30 | #494 |
| **#513 — conventions** | The new package emits **CAMB and PSALTer conventions natively** — no translation layer. Conformal time already agrees with `camb.symbolic`. Gauge is an explicit named input, applied symbolically, carried as spec metadata, asserted at the CAMB seam | H4, 2026-08-31 | `repo_reshape.md` §2.8 |
| **`derive` port gate** | **Not a byte diff** — a consequence of #513. The frozen legacy spec is the oracle *for the physics*; equivalence is semantic, recorded as a written mapping | H4, 2026-08-31 | `repo_reshape.md` §5.2, #525 |
| **Namespace** | Fresh top-level **`tidalcosmo`**, in this repo, renaming to `tidal` after legacy deletion (M7) | user, 2026-08-31 | `repo_reshape.md` §1.3, #490 |
| **Migration shape** | Strangler fig: new code **never imports legacy**; capabilities *ported*, never adapted; two suites; oracle frozen as committed **data** at M0.5 *before* porting, which is what makes early deletion safe | H4, 2026-08-31 | `repo_reshape.md` §7–8, #525 |
| **WS6 algorithm** | **Schur-complement kinetic-matrix criterion** (arXiv:2506.02111) as primary, pole masses/residues as cross-check. Bypasses the radicals that make residue analysis intractable for parity-violating theories | H6, 2026-09-03 | `spectrum_design.md` §5 |
| **WS6 architecture** | **Two stages**: Wolfram/PSALTer once at derivation time exporting a coupling-linear tensor contract; numeric evaluation per sample, no Wolfram in any hot path | H6, 2026-09-03 | `spectrum_design.md` §1 |
| **WS6 scope** | **Minkowski-only is correct and sufficient** — the spectrum screens *in vacuo*; the same split TorC uses | H6, 2026-09-03 | `spectrum_design.md` §2 |
| **`J^P` labels** | Exported **explicitly**. The positional convention is disproven — A23Theory yields J-blocks mixing parities | H8, 2026-09-04 | `pub_wxf.py` warning |
| **Tier-1 vs Tier-2 gate** | Gate the **install** on Tier 1 (author's own input *and* committed `.mx` oracle, so a mismatch can only be the install); Tier 2 mixes install-correctness with our authoring and does not localize. **Requires pinned SHAs** — they default to `HEAD` no longer | H8 + orchestrator, 2026-09-04 | `stage1_engineering_plan.md`, #526 |
| **Term-roster exclusion** | Excluded from the Stage-1 contract | H6/H8, 2026-09-04 | `spectrum_design.md` §6.1 |
| **Config layer** | Build it provisionally, **mark it disposable** — WS1's real surface must *replace* it, not extend it. The failure mode is a provisional layer becoming the de facto config by accretion | orchestrator, 2026-09-04 | #527 |
| **`Method→"Hard"`** | A **dead option** on v2.0.2 — declared, never read. It never gated anything; the cost to measure is plain `ParticleSpectrum` wall time | H8, 2026-09-04 | #521 |
| **Linearity enforcement** | **Ours, not PSALTer's** — `NonLinearCouplings` is never thrown and a bare numeric coefficient passes silently. Our validator is load-bearing for correctness | H8, 2026-09-04 | #522, #527 |
| **WXF** | Something we **produce**, not an interchange we receive: PSALTer writes no WXF and populates two association keys; the exporter reads private `$Local*` globals | H8, 2026-09-04 | #523 |
| **WS6 dependency** | **Not** independent — contradicting an earlier claim in this document; H2's dependency graph governs | H4 correction, 2026-08-31 | `observable_ladder.md` |
| **WKB sequencing** | Matrix-WKB is **built alongside Magnus in the first WS3 handoff**, not gated behind a bake-off. The bake-off decides composition and thresholds on measured numbers; no candidate is discounted on paper estimates | user, 2026-09-05/06 | `solver_design.md` §8/§12, #519 |
| **Admissible theories** | Scoped **explicitly**: only theories admitting the assumed background are in scope, the user judges whether theirs qualifies, and the background-EOM residual is a **first-class per-theory gate** rather than a diagnostic | user, 2026-09-05 | `spectator_route.md` §3, #501, #531 |
| **Oracle re-run rule** | **If `tidal/` or `examples/data/` changes, re-run `scripts/oracles/` in the same commit.** Stated as an action, not a prohibition — "never edit legacy" is unenforceable and would forbid fixing an open bug, whereas this is checkable at review and keeps the frozen oracle honest by construction | I-525 + orchestrator, 2026-09-06 | `repo_reshape.md` §8, `tests_cosmo/data/oracles/README.md` |
| **Guardrails retire too** | `tests_cosmo/test_package_boundary.py` and the shell-out check are **deleted at M7, not adapted** — after `git mv tidalcosmo tidal` their own regexes match every legitimate import, so the guard inverts into a blocker | I-525, 2026-09-06 | #537, §7's M7 row |
| **Verification gates** | Made **able to fail** — `tidalcosmo/` had been outside pyright, coverage, `testpaths` and CI, and the never-import-legacy rule had no test | coherence pass, 2026-09-04 | `8b54fe6e`, #524 |

### Still open, deliberately

| | |
|---|---|
| **When to start the `tidalcosmo` version line** | Natural trigger: M0, or O0 first passing. No cost to deferring |
| **GPL/MIT on the Barker-derived code (#495)** | A **release** gate, not an implementation one. Implementation proceeds; distribution does not |
| **Whether non-sampled constants enter the coupling vector** | Decides whether `A[0]` is legitimate (recommended: yes, they stay out, so the linearity check becomes "no *sampled* coupling appears non-linearly"). **Documents cannot settle this — it needs a real export** (#522) |
| **O4a's precondition** | Whether the chosen operator is `n = 0` with `β` constant over recombination. Determines whether the settled rung order's cheap rung exists (#503) |

## Decisions (user, 2026-08-29)

| # | Decision |
|---|---|
| D1 | Target CMB observables via genuine perturbation evolution. The point is the **general engine**; birefringence is one supervisor-stated end goal among several. |
| D2 | No paper target fixed; order workstreams by dependency. |
| D3 | Reshape the repo around the Cobaya-extension goal — restructuring **should be done** where right; no attachment to the current layout. |
| D4 | No HPC without explicit permission. Local only. |
| D5 | Optimization is a standing first-class concern — adoption depends on it. |
| D6 | PSALTer-numerical: build our version **taking heavy, deliberate inspiration from Barker's code** (`psalter.tar.gz` + SupplementalMaterials-2607 + arXiv:2606.30785). Author permission is explicit; copy freely; provenance in docstrings; attribution settled with supervisor at publication. Not clean-room. |
| D7 | The solver targets the general case; cancellations are auto-detected fast paths (as `can_use_modal` does), never scoping decisions. |
| D8 | Don't overspecialize early — CS/birefringence is one instance; engine and plan stay general. |
| D9 | Migrate inference into the Cobaya ecosystem (Cobaya ships PolyChord); much of `tidal/inference/` is then superseded; redesign deliberate. |

## Observable ladder

Ordered by pipeline-validation value; each rung has a checkable answer before the next
adds unknowns.

| # | Observable | Exercises | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **O0** | ΛCDM `C_ℓ`, new physics off (pass-through mode) | plumbing: Cobaya wiring, CAMB products, sampler, likelihood | reproduces CAMB `C_ℓ` + standard ΛCDM posterior; any TIDAL-computed piece sub-percent vs CAMB/nanoCMB, `2 ≤ ℓ ≤ 2500` |
| **O1** | **Fixed-table pass-through** (H1 §R1): one `(a, ρ, P)` table generated offline at a chosen `(Ω_Λ, ϖ_r)` from TorC's published formulas, fed through our optional tabulated-background hook. Table generation is one-off data prep, **not** a package feature; no TorC physics inside the package | the hook + Cobaya wiring + CAMB seam, end to end | drive CAMB to the same `H(a)` and `C_ℓ` as a reference build. **Not** a posterior reproduction — see the note below. **First target.** |
| **O2** | **Spectator perturbations on ΛCDM** — first: modified tensor/GW propagation (friction `ν`, mass `μ`, speed `c_T` derived from the Lagrangian) → tensor transfer → B-modes | the spine: TIDAL FRW-derived equations + new solver, strict spectator | TorC explicitly deferred this; first genuinely new result. Validity flags per run. Cembranos (local): `μ ≤ 10⁻³³ eV` does nothing; friction `ν` matters strongly |
| **O3** | **Gertsenshtein mixing on FRW** — graviton↔photon with Hubble damping | time-dependent solver on the thesis's own physics; **core goal** (thesis couplings) | GH #209; Cembranos arXiv:2302.08186 (local); reduces to flat-space result as `H → 0` **Requires an assumed PMF model** (`magnetic_field_background.md`) — an extra, irreducible assumption no other rung carries; its own spectator status `r_B ≈ 10⁻⁷ B₋₉²` is computed per run, not imported. **Different solver kind from O2** (eikonal + patch averaging, see below). |
| **O4** | **Cosmic birefringence (E→B)** + V-modes | parity-odd sector + polarization observables | `β = 0.277° ± 0.057°` (4.8σ, joint ACT+Planck, arXiv:2608.06480); distinctive channels beat the `N_eff` bound where broadband conversion does not |

**Two O4 prerequisites, found 2026-08-30 — neither is a lookup, both are derivation work:**

- **Frequency scaling has no single answer.** It is *per-operator*, and TIDAL's own theory
  documents do not derive it: `general_quadratic_lagrangian.tex` contains no
  frequency-scaling discussion, and its CS section states only that `χ^CS_2` sources
  magnetic helicity `A·B`. The Das et al. `ξ₁ ∇T×F̃` structure gives `α = 2ξ₁p²T₁t` (`ν²`);
  an induced-axion `θFF̃` gives `ν⁰`. These are *different sectors* in the enumeration's
  language (`ζ̃₁₋₆` vs `d₁₈`/`χ^CS`), so "the torsion coupling's scaling" is not a
  well-posed question. Scope it as a derivation task per operator (**GH #499**).
- **No example implements the Chern–Simons couplings.**
  `examples/torsion_gertsenshtein/theory_parity_odd.toml` explicitly *defers* `cs1`–`cs3`
  ("require bare `A_μ`, special handling"). O4 therefore needs new derivation work, and
  the bare-`A_μ` gauge handling is an unsolved problem, not a configuration step (**GH #499**).
  (That file's `description` field claimed CS *was* included, contradicting its own
  header; corrected 2026-08-30.)

O0 is the validation gate, then O1. Strategic note (H7): CMB bounds from broadband
conversion are typically weaker than `N_eff` unless the signal is spectrally narrow or
structurally distinctive — V-modes and birefringence are exactly that, justifying the
polarization emphasis on physics grounds.

### Rung order after O1 — SETTLED (user, 2026-09-04)

**`O0 → O1 → O2 → O4a → O3 → O4b/V-modes`.** H2's recommendation
(`observable_ladder.md` §5), adopted. The numbering O1→O2→O3→O4 is **capability order**;
this is the execution order.

The choice was a pure scientific-priority call, because it is **technically neutral**: the
coherence audit confirmed H3's implementation order and H4's migration order both survive
either ordering, since O4a needs no solver at all. O2 is first either way and builds the
spine both routes reuse.

**Why O4a before O3.** O4a (isotropic `β`, post-processing rotation) is the cheapest new
observable in the ladder: the CS/photon sector is conformally invariant, so `a(η)` drops out
and `β` is a dispersion relation integrated against a zero-mode — **no FRW photon solver at
all**, and the observable is an array rotation of CAMB's `C_ℓ` (Tier 3a, against O2/O3's
Tier 3b). It reuses O1's wiring, it is the only rung targeting a **positive 4.8σ signal**
rather than an upper limit, and its derivation work (#503) sits on the thesis's parity-odd
critical path regardless. It also exercises the validity machinery on a cheap rung before
O3 needs it.

> **⚠ Precondition to carry forward.** O4a stays cheap **only if** the chosen operator is
> `n = 0` **and** `β` is effectively constant over recombination. Otherwise it is O4b, which
> is much more expensive, and the ordering advantage disappears. **#503's per-operator
> derivation is what determines whether the cheap route exists** — so #503 is not merely a
> prerequisite of O4a, it is the gate on this ordering.

O3 remains the core scientific goal and is unchanged in importance by being third; it
carries the most unknowns of any rung (a second solver kind, a mandatory PMF model, an
amplitude-based measurement, and a GR signal unobservable by 11+ orders, so its result is a
torsion-*enhancement bound* whose interpretation leans on exactly the background-consistency
and spectator flags O2 and O4a exercise first).

## The niche (H7 investigation, 2026-08-29)

**"Arbitrary Lagrangian → spectator-sector perturbations on fixed ΛCDM → observables →
Cobaya likelihood" is empty**, verified by enumerating near-misses: xPand/xAct (symbolic
only), CppTransport/PyTransport (inflation only, arXiv:1609.00380/1), hi_class (Horndeski
gravity sector, full backreaction, arXiv:1909.01828), SymBoltz.jl (equations in, not
actions, arXiv:2509.24740 — possible future backend). **Nobody has treated torsion as a
spectator on FRW at all**; arXiv:2506.17017 and TorC both signpost cosmological
perturbation theory as future work. Full findings: `docs/cosmology/spectator_route.md`.

Order: **WS0 → WS1 → WS2 ∥ WS3 → WS4 → WS5.**

**WS6 is NOT independent** (corrected 2026-08-31, flagged by H4). It was listed that way
originally; H2's own dependency graph (`observable_ladder.md`) has
`WS6 -.gates.-> O2` and `WS6 -.gates.-> O3`, and PSALTer's `_extract/likelihood.py` shows
why: on the **sampling path** the vacuum-spectrum screen is what rejects sick coupling
points before they reach the solver. WS6 can be *built* in parallel, but O2 and O3 depend
on it once either is sampled rather than run at a single point.

**FRW is blocked in three independent places, each owned by a different workstream** (found
2026-08-30). No single fix clears it, and they must be tracked separately:

| # | Blocker | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| a | Modal solver refuses non-trivial `volume_element` and any `time_dependent` term (`tidal/solver/modal.py`) | WS3 (#492) |
| b | Hamiltonian/energy export filters `t` (`ExportJSON.wl:1638`; `_energy.py` hardcodes `t=0.0`) | WS2 (#491) |
| c | **Conversion measurement is energy-ratio-based**, so it inherits (b)'s `t=0.0` bug *and* the `P_max`-vs-`P_final` distinction | WS4 (#493) |

(c) is the dangerous one: it would silently corrupt an O3 number rather than fail loudly.

**Cost basis:** use the **v0.33.9 measured table** in `docs/tex/derivation_performance.tex`.
The per-theory derivation-timing headers in the TOMLs are declared untrustworthy there
(§lines 108–114) — treat them as ceilings, not estimates.

- **WS0 — Research & scoping** (no code): handoffs H1–H5; integration-target decision —
  **SETTLED by H3 (2026-08-31, `docs/cosmology/solver_design.md` §6): option (iii), own
  solver chained to unmodified CAMB, for BOTH engines over one shared core.** O3 forces
  it regardless of the O2 verdict (Boltzmann codes are `k`-resolved but frequency-*integrated*
  — one photon fluid per `k`, not a photon state per `ν`; see `solver_design.md` §2.1's
  amendment — so there is no per-frequency photon
  propagation); DISCO-EB stays the fallback only if gradient sampling ever becomes a
  requirement (GPL decision recorded: learn freely, never copy literally — #516 closed).
- **WS1 — New package, strangler-fig**: the existing framework is **legacy, not a
  template**. New package designed whole, from the goal backwards (H4); **new code never
  imports old code — no adapters**; useful capabilities are *fully ported* (redesigned,
  with docstrings/why-comments/issue references traveling along; original kept as test
  oracle). Two fully separated packages/CLIs during transition; old `tidal` stays for
  cross-checks; legacy retired deliberately once covered.

**⚠ The `derive` port gate is NOT a byte diff** (H4 §5.2 — this supersedes earlier
orchestrator guidance that byte-equality on spec JSON was the strongest gate). That held
only while we assumed legacy notation would be preserved. **#513 decides the opposite**:
the rebuilt symbolic layer emits **CAMB and PSALTer conventions natively** — no conversion
layer — so variable names, formats and gauge conventions change *deliberately*, and
`tidal inspect OLD --diff NEW` would report every intended change as a failure.
The gate instead: the frozen legacy spec stays the oracle **for the physics**, and
equivalence is established by careful comparison — same equations, coefficients and signs
under the new naming — **recorded as a written mapping committed alongside the fixtures**.
Slower and more human than a diff; the honest gate for a deliberate reformatting. `--diff`
stays useful *within* the new package for unintended drift between re-derivations.

- **WS2 — General expanding background**: symbolic derivation with unspecified `a(η)`,
  `H(η)`; conformal time as a first-class coordinate; CAMB-table coefficient evaluation;
  conformal-weight fast-path detection (general path always the fallback; the conformal
  case doubles as a machine-precision test); fix the time-dependent Hamiltonian/energy
  export bug (`ExportJSON.wl:1638`, `_energy.py` `t=0.0`) Wolfram-side.
- **WS3 — Solver research** (the hard one): replace `expm(M·t)` for `M(η)`. Ladder:
  (1) exponential midpoint → (2) 4th-order Gauss–Legendre Magnus, batched over k
  (reduces exactly to `expm(Mt)` for constant M) → (3) adiabatic/WKB regime switching for
  `kη ≫ 1` — **the research gap**: oscode/riccati are scalar-only; no matrix RKWKB solver
  exists; template = neutrino oscillations in matter (arXiv:0803.1967) → (4)
  piecewise-analytic transfer matrices (Haddadin & Handley arXiv:1809.11095) → (5)
  emulation, last resort. Magnus alone still resolves every oscillation
  (`∫‖M‖ds < π`, `‖M‖ ~ k`) — step 3 is not optional. Batching only for fixed-step
  structured methods; never stack modes into one adaptive ODE. Budget: 10× slower than
  CAMB is fine, 100× is fatal (the tight-coupling lesson: CLASS 1069 s → 19.4 s).
  **Design complete (H3, 2026-08-31): `docs/cosmology/solver_design.md`** — two engines
  (mode-equation ladder for O2; eikonal amplitude engine + patch averaging for O3) over
  one shared core; the binding cost is coefficient *assembly*, not the exponential;
  every candidate ships as a registry backend and the composition is decided by the
  bake-off (#492, #517–#520).
- **WS4 — Observables**: vector observables; line-of-sight sources; per-rung observables;
  post-processing rotation exact only for constant/isotropic/frequency-independent
  effects, else inside the LOS integral (arXiv:2209.07804); cross-validate vs nanoCMB
  (arXiv:2602.23466), CAMB, class_rot (arXiv:2111.14199).
- **WS5 — Cobaya extension**: Theory class as above; latest upstream CAMB + Cobaya;
  likelihoods per rung (no drop-in birefringence likelihood exists — escalate: Gaussian
  prior on published `β` → fork `LilleJohs/cosmic-birefringence-planck-act` (MIT) →
  SPT-3G BB lite for anisotropic).
- **WS6 — Numerical polology**: **design settled by H6** — `docs/cosmology/spectrum_design.md`
  is the authority (it supersedes the #360 plan as the starting point). Adapt Barker's
  published code (D6) into `tidalcosmo/spectrum/` **and implement the unimplemented
  Schur-complement criterion** (arXiv:2506.02111) as the primary algorithm, residues as
  cross-check; cross-check vs SupplementalMaterials-2607 (JAX kernels *and* the committed
  Julia `*_unitarity_NS` chains); reproduce Lin–Hobson–Lasenby inequalities; Minkowski-only is
  correct and sufficient (spectrum screens in vacuo; TorC used the same split). **H8's three open questions — answered (orchestrator, 2026-09-04):**

1. **Yes, amend the design.** `spectrum_design.md` §4.5/§14.1 name `Method→"Hard"`, and
   `handoffs/H8.md` went further and made its cost *the* go/no-go for the two-stage
   architecture. On v2.0.2 (`bb45adb0`) the option is **declared but never read** (#521), so
   both statements are wrong and one of them is a stated gate. A finding that invalidates an
   instruction belongs where the instruction lives, not only in a measurements record — the
   same rule applied to the `cond(V)` principle. Amend §4.5/§14.1, **pinned to the version**
   (a later PSALTer release could implement it), and the cost to measure is simply
   `ParticleSpectrum` wall time.
2. **Gate on Tier 1; Tier 2 is the physics gate.** H8's recommendation, confirmed, for the
   reason that an *install* gate must fail unambiguously: Tier 1's input and its committed
   `.mx` result are both the author's, so a mismatch can only be the install. Tier 2 mixes
   install-correctness with our own authoring, so a failure does not localize.
3. **Build the provisional config layer, but mark it disposable.** WS1 is next in the
   dependency order yet is *not dispatched*, so "imminent" is not knowable — and blocking
   Stage-1 on it could stall indefinitely. Build the minimal input model, name it so nobody
   mistakes it for the surface, and make it a hard requirement that WS1's real surface
   **replaces** it rather than extending it. The failure mode to avoid is a provisional layer
   quietly becoming the de facto config by accretion.

Stage-1 Wolfram engineering was split out as handoff **H8** — **done as a study**
(`docs/cosmology/stage1_engineering_plan.md`); the engineering itself is not yet dispatched.
Its sole blocker is the PSALTer install (#526), which also gates #521, #522 and #523.

## Parked

`feat/ws2-localized-path-audit` / #477 arc: **already halted** (issues arose making it
not possible; likely unrelated to the new direction). Parked as-is with state recorded on
the issue. Also parked: Phase E (T6/T8 rescue), Phase A-γ, NEXT_PHASES G/H/I, Wolfram CI
(#69). Nothing gates on any of it.

## Handoffs

Prompt files in `docs/cosmology/handoffs/` — self-contained, dispatched by the user to
separate sessions; **this orchestrator session does not launch them**. H7 was executed
during planning; its findings are in `docs/cosmology/spectator_route.md`.

**All eight are complete.** Each prompt file carries a status header giving its date,
artifact and outcome. They are kept, not deleted: a prompt records *what was asked*, which
is what lets a reader judge whether the deliverable answered it. **None is an open
assignment** — H2.md in particular opens "if it does not exist yet, ask before proceeding",
which was live instruction text for a task finished five days earlier.

| ID | Task | Artifact |
|---|---|---|
| H1 | TorC pipeline audit — **DONE** (2026-08-30). Settled R1 (O1 = fixed-table pass-through, above) and R2 (re-apply the CAMB patch, GH #498). Also for WS5: the provider→consumer wiring template (§3.1), the `planck_clik` NaN guard as a flagged rejection path (§3.3), and a caution that stock Cobaya's PolyChord does not give correct evidences under non-uniform priors without the Ormondroyd patch (§3.2). For the spectator flags: `ΔN_eff` (§1.7) is already parameterized for the torsion sector | `docs/cosmology/torc_pipeline_audit.md` ✅ |
| H2 | Observable-ladder feasibility — **DONE** (2026-08-30). Found O3 needs a *different solver kind* from O2 (10²⁹ vs 10³ oscillations → eikonal + patch averaging; H3.md extended accordingly), that O4 splits into three channels with different prerequisites, and that no paper enforces the PMF's own spectator status | `docs/cosmology/observable_ladder.md` + `magnetic_field_background.md` ✅ |
| H3 | Solver design study — **DONE** (2026-08-31). Two engines over one shared core; architecture (iii) settled; assembly (not expm) identified as the binding cost; six-stepper prototype registry with measured orders; matrix-WKB designed + prototyped (bake-off-gated, #519); 18-paper reference set acquired. Follow-ups #517–#520 | `docs/cosmology/solver_design.md` ✅ |
| H4 | New-package design — **DONE** (2026-08-31). Target layout + `tidalcosmo/` scaffold (READMEs only, no Python); port inventory; **#513** adopt CAMB/PSALTer conventions natively (gauge as spec metadata), which is why the `derive` gate cannot be a byte diff; #514–#516 | `docs/cosmology/repo_reshape.md` ✅ |
| H5 | Literature acquisition — **DONE** (2026-08-30). 20/20 fetched and title-verified; `literature/README.md` now tracked and auto-generated by `scripts/bibaudit/index_literature.py` (GH #497) | populated `literature/` + `docs/references.md` ✅ |
| H8 | Stage-1 engineering — **DONE as a STUDY** (2026-09-04; user pivoted it to "research + recommend, report to the orchestrator"). Install route, three-tier verification, derivation-branch architecture, exporter design, cost protocol, plus `scripts/research/psalter_stage1/` (rescues H6's WXF decoders from /tmp; pinned upstream fetch script — the route, not the GPL payload). **Six live-source findings correct H6** — chiefly that `Method→"Hard"` is a **dead option** (#521), so the "go/no-go cost" I wrote into the prompt was based on a false premise and is simply `ParticleSpectrum` wall time | `docs/cosmology/stage1_engineering_plan.md` ✅ |
| H6 | Numerical polology design — **DONE** (2026-09-03). Two-stage architecture (symbolic PSALTer once per structure → JAX per sample, order-ms); **primary algorithm = the Schur-complement kinetic-matrix criterion of arXiv:2506.02111** (published, worked, implemented nowhere — we implement it; it handles massive–massless kinetic mixing and carries parity-odd support), residue route kept as permanent cross-check; massless sector handled by counting + compiled Stage-1 closed forms + numerical fallback (the released code's `\|Re m\|>0.01` guard would reject GR+Maxwell); Stage-1 export contract defined (explicit `J^P` labels — the WXF `J`-blocks are unlabeled and mix parities, verified on `A23Theory`); seven-group validation set incl. the LHL gate and published EC/TorC oracles; reconciled with H4 (§3.2 — confirms #513 with a hard reason: the residue's parity factor is *defined by* the signature). License → release blocker on #495 | `docs/cosmology/spectrum_design.md` ✅ |
| H7 | Spectator-route scope — **DONE** | `docs/cosmology/spectator_route.md` |

Dispatch order: **H1–H8 all ✅ done.** Stage-1 *engineering* is not yet dispatched — H8 studied it and produced the route; see `stage1_engineering_plan.md`. (H3 absorbed the
post-dispatch scope extension — both solver kinds designed — plus the 2026-08-31 user
directions: Wolfram-at-derivation-only symbolic policy, experimentation-over-reading
bake-off, uniform+stochastic B̄ modes, soft classifier.)

## Implementation delegation protocol

How implementation work leaves this program document and comes back. **The wave board
below is the single source of truth for where things stand** — a session with no other
context should be able to read it and the queue, and know what to do next.

### The loop

1. **Orchestrator writes prompts** into `docs/cosmology/handoffs/` as an `I-<issue>.md`
   file (the `I-` series; `H-` was the research series, all complete).
2. **The user dispatches** each prompt to a separate session. *This orchestrator session
   never launches them.*
3. A delegate works in **its own git worktree** off `feat/cosmology-program`
   (`git worktree add /tmp/tidal-i<issue> -b cosmo/i<issue>-<slug> feat/cosmology-program`),
   **never merges**, and reports its branch back.
4. **The user relays a short update**; the orchestrator runs the merge checklist, merges,
   and updates the board **in the same commit**.
5. At a wave boundary the orchestrator updates memory, and the next wave is **planned
   fresh** rather than executed from a pre-baked plan — later waves are shaped by what
   earlier ones found.

### Prompt template

Header (issue · milestone · wave · **Wolfram lane y/n** · dependencies · **owned paths**)
→ context and an *ordered reading list* naming sections, not whole documents → the
**interface contract** (what it consumes, what it produces, with exact references) →
**quantitative success criteria stated before any code**, plus the tests to add under
`tests_cosmo/` → a **scope fence** naming the adjacent temptations explicitly → working
rules → the **flaw protocol** → the report-back format.

**Working rules every prompt carries:**

- Worktree off `feat/cosmology-program`; branch `cosmo/i<issue>-<slug>`; **never merge**;
  never touch the shared working directory (it is the orchestrator's alone).
- **Never version-bump, tag, or edit the changelog.** This overrides `CLAUDE.md`'s
  default-to-bumping rule: parallel delegates share `.git` refs, so concurrent bumps
  guarantee a `pyproject.toml` conflict and a tag collision. The orchestrator bumps once
  per wave.
- **Stay inside your owned paths** (listed in the header). Two sessions writing the same
  directory is the one collision a worktree does not prevent.
- **Any guard you add carries its expiry.** When you write a test, assertion, lint rule or
  CI gate, ask in the same breath *what future change makes this wrong rather than merely
  unnecessary?* If there is one, record it **both** where the guard lives and in the row of
  §7's milestone table that will trigger it. A guard's correctness has a lifetime, and the
  moment of writing is the only moment its expiry is obvious — the merge checklist cannot
  catch it, because such a failure bites at a milestone nothing is tested against yet.
  (Found the hard way: `test_package_boundary.py` inverts into a blocker at M7, when
  `git mv tidalcosmo tidal` makes its own regex match every legitimate import — #537.)
- One `wolframscript` at a time, machine-wide — only a prompt flagged for the Wolfram lane
  may start a kernel.
- Conventional commits; no attribution trailers.

**Flaw protocol** — what to do on finding the design wrong:

- A **design-document contradiction or error**: amend it *at the instruction site*, pinned
  to the version, and report it. Do not work around it silently and do not only note it in
  the report — the next reader of that instruction must see the correction.
- An **architectural contradiction** (the design cannot be built as specified): **stop and
  report.** Do not redesign in a delegate session.

**Report back:** branch name · gates run, with their output · amendments made · anything
discovered that the orchestrator should route · suggested next step.

### Orchestrator merge checklist

Run for every reported branch — this is what keeps coherence continuous rather than
requiring another end-of-phase sweep:

1. Read the **full diff**, not a summary.
2. Run every gate: `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `pyright`, `cspell`, **both**
   suites, the boundary test. **Cap BLAS threads when running the suite** —
   `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 MKL_NUM_THREADS=1 NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1`.
   Several sessions share one 8-core machine, and an unrestricted run takes ~3 cores of
   BLAS on its own; that is enough to make the wall-clock assertions in
   `test_probe_perf` and `test_inference_eval_perf` fail spuriously (observed: 400 ms
   against an 80 ms budget, where the probe's known quiet cost is 13–27 ms). A timing
   failure under load is not a regression — check the load before reading it as one.
3. Verify the prompt's success criteria **positively, from artifacts** — never from the
   session's report alone.
4. Propagate any instruction-site amendment the session should have made and did not.
5. Merge; close issues with commit references; **update the wave board and the queue in
   the merge commit**; put a status header on the prompt file.
6. At a wave boundary: memory + backup.

### The Wolfram lane

One `wolframscript` machine-wide, so **at most one lane-flagged session is ever active** —
the orchestrator included. The next occupant starts only once the previous lane work is
**merged and its gate independently re-run**: once a long run begins, the lane offers no
verification window. Runs that can span a day (the Stage-1 cost measurement, 24 h ceiling)
are **launch-and-collect** — a detached script, collected by a later session.

### Wave board

Status: `drafted → dispatched → reported → merged`.

| Wave | Prompt | Issue | Lane | Owned paths | Branch | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | I-524 — packaging, extras, CI lane | #524 | — | `pyproject.toml`, `.github/`, `tidalcosmo/__init__.py`, `tidalcosmo/cli/` | — | drafted |
| 0 | I-525 — freeze the legacy oracle | #525 | — | `scripts/oracles/`, `tests_cosmo/data/` | `cosmo/i525-oracles` | **merged** ✅ gate re-run independently: 185 fixtures current, regeneration byte-identical |
| 0 | I-526 — install PSALTer, Tier-1 gate | #526 | **yes** | `scripts/install-psalter.sh`, `scripts/verify-wolfram-setup.sh`, `tests_cosmo/fixtures/` | — | drafted |
| 1 | I-532 — CAMB seam, background protocol, flag schema | #532 | — | `tidalcosmo/{background,spectator,validity}/` | — | planned |
| 1 | I-503 — per-operator dispersion + zero-mode scope | #503 | — | `research/lagrangian_enumeration/`, `docs/` | — | planned |
| 1 | I-S1A — Stage-1 Python side | #527 | — | `tidalcosmo/{config,derive}/` (Python only), `tidalcosmo/spectrum/` | — | planned |
| 2 | I-S1B — Stage-1 Wolfram side + cost run | #495 | **yes** | `tidalcosmo/derive/wolfram/` | — | outline |
| 2 | M1b — Cobaya Theory + ΛCDM posterior | — | — | `tidalcosmo/{spectator,presets,likelihoods}/` | — | outline |
| 2 | M2/O1 — CAMB fork re-apply | #498 | — | fork repo + `tidalcosmo/background/` | — | outline |

**Wave 3+, named only:** WS2 FRW derive (lane), then the O2 fan-out — WS2 background +
residual ∥ WS3 solver ∥ WS4 line-of-sight ∥ WS6 Stage-2. WS3's first handoff carries
**Magnus and matrix-WKB together** (`solver_design.md` §12), written from the ground up for
a time-dependent background; nothing is ported from `modal.py` and it is not an oracle.

### Wave-boundary checklist

What the next planning session does *first*, before planning anything:

1. Confirm every row of the wave reads `merged`.
2. Re-run the full gate set once on the merged trunk.
3. Read the delegates' reported discoveries and **route** each — amend at the site, open an
   issue, or fold into the next wave's scope.
4. **Prune stale worktrees.** `git worktree list`; for each entry whose branch is an
   ancestor of `HEAD` and whose tree is clean, `git worktree remove` it and delete the
   branch. **Never touch a worktree whose session is still active** — check for unmerged
   commits and uncommitted changes first. A stale registration holding a branch ref
   quietly confuses a later `git worktree list`.
5. Update memory (`project_cosmology_program.md`, the MEMORY.md status line) and back up.
6. *Then* plan the next wave, in detail; the one after it in outline; nothing beyond.

## What to implement next

The program is **design-complete**, has passed the pre-implementation scientific review
(`docs/cosmology/scientific_review.md`), and is entering implementation.
**Wave 0 is drafted and ready to dispatch** — see the wave board above. In dependency order:

1. **#524 (M0)** — packaging: second console script, extras, YAML package-data, the CI lane.
   The verification gates themselves are already live (`8b54fe6e`, `7b6f7a17`).
2. **#525 (M0.5)** — freeze the legacy oracle as committed data, **before any porting
   begins**. This is what decouples port order from deletion order and makes retiring
   `tidal/inference/` at M1b safe.
3. **#532 / M1a → O0 (seam half)** — `background/protocol.py` (defined by investigating
   CAMB's API; it is the session's first deliverable), `background/camb_seam.py`,
   `spectator/` pass-through, `validity/flags.py` with **both flag severities** defined.
   Gate: **machine-precision identity** on the pass-through path, seam-product spot checks,
   a gauge-mismatch refusal test, flag-schema unit tests.

   > *Amended 2026-09-06.* This step pointed at **#491**, which is the WS2 **symbolic**
   > tracker — a session dispatched against it would pull Wolfram work into a non-lane
   > slot. M1 now splits into M1a/M1b (#532 is the new M1a issue; M1 had none). Its old
   > gate, "sub-percent agreement with CAMB", was **circular**: a pass-through returns
   > CAMB's own arrays, so it passes by construction while staying loose enough to hide a
   > unit or `ℓ(ℓ+1)/2π` slip.
4. **M1b → O0 (inference half)** — the Cobaya `Theory` class and packaging. Gate: our
   pass-through Theory's ΛCDM posterior ≡ a plain-CAMB Cobaya run within sampling noise,
   plus #515's duplicated-compute benchmark. Retires `tidal/inference/`.
5. **#498 / M2 → O1** — the CAMB fork first (re-apply off `2.0.3`), then `TabulatedBackground`.

**In parallel, unblocked by the above:** **#526** — install PSALTer and pass the Tier-1 gate.
It is the single blocker behind #521, #522 and #523, so it converts three stalled issues into
one afternoon. WS6 (#495) is buildable any time after M0.

**Also parallel, and it gates the settled rung order:** **#503** — the per-operator photon
dispersion relations. Whether O4a is the cheap rung depends on its answer — though note
#503 settles only *half* the precondition (the frequency exponent `n`); "`β` constant over
recombination" is a property of the torsion zero-mode's evolution and needs its own owner.

**Open physics question, tracked and scoped:** **#531** — whether an FRW background solves
the PGT field equations. The thesis proves `T̄ = 0` exact on *flat Minkowski*; FRW is open.
Handled by scoping admissible theories, testing the background-EOM residual per theory
(#501), and surveying the research rather than attempting to settle it.

## Verification gates

- **WS1:** suite green; no old-code imports from new code; pyright clean.
- **WS2:** de Sitter analytics reproduced; conformal fast path ≡ general path to machine
  precision; FRW-derived EOM → Minkowski EOM as `a → const`; validity flags on every run
  artifact.
- **WS3:** each ladder rung agrees with the previous to stated tolerance; constant-`M`
  limit reproduces `expm(Mt)` to machine precision; per-call timing recorded per rung
  (~82 ms current baseline; <1 s CAMB reference).
- **WS4/O0:** pass-through reproduces CAMB `C_ℓ` and a standard ΛCDM posterior.
- **WS5/O1 (narrowed by H1 §R1):** a fixed `(a, ρ, P)` table driven through the
  tabulated-background hook reproduces a reference CAMB build's `H(a)` and `C_ℓ` at the
  same `(Ω_Λ, ϖ_r)`. **Second, free oracle:** at TorC's own fiducial point
  (`ϖ_r = 0.8`, `Ω_Λ = 0.685`) `ρ_Λ^eff` never changes sign and `|w| ≤ 0.998` — poles
  appear only at `ϖ_r > 1` — so the same table pushed through stock CAMB's
  `set_w_a_table` must agree with our patched path. Disagreement then localizes a
  re-apply bug rather than a physics one.
  **Posterior reproduction is NOT a gate**, but be precise about why (H1 correction).
  *Exact* reproduction is impossible: no Cobaya run configuration is archived, so
  `num_repeats`, the precision criterion and the seed are unrecoverable. *Statistical*
  comparison, however, **is** available — `_equal_weights.txt` is archived for all seven
  runs and `.paramnames` carries `H0`, `omegam`, `sigma8` and the `S_8` variants as
  derived parameters, so marginal posteriors are obtainable via `anesthetic`; the paper
  simply never printed a table. So a later O1b could compare contours and check `log Z`
  against the stated ±0.22 — but **not** lean on Δ`log Z`, which would carry an unknown
  systematic from the unknown `num_repeats`. The four evidences (H1 §5.3) are the only
  numbers the paper itself states.
- **WS6:** Lin–Hobson–Lasenby inequalities reproduced exactly; agreement with the
  supplementary-materials implementation on pole masses/residues.

All local (D4).
