# TIDAL Pipeline Roadmap

> **AMENDMENT (2026-09-04): most of this roadmap is PARKED.**
>
> The project pivoted on 2026-08-29 to the **cosmology program** — a Cobaya extension
> evolving spectator perturbations on a CAMB LCDM background (umbrella **#488**, record at
> `docs/COSMOLOGY_PROGRAM.md`). **Phases E, G, H and I below, and the Wolfram-CI item #69,
> are parked**, not cancelled: they describe real work on a pipeline that still exists and
> still runs, but nothing is being picked up from here.
>
> **Phase I in particular** (eigenvalue/dispersion solver, in `docs/NEXT_PHASES.md`) is
> superseded in substance by **WS6 / #495**, which builds the same capability on a settled
> design. Do not start it from this document.
>
> Anything you were about to start from this roadmap: check `docs/COSMOLOGY_PROGRAM.md` first.

This document outlines the planned improvements and features for the TIDAL symbolic physics pipeline project.

**Last Updated:** September 2026 (v0.52.0) — parked, see the amendment above
**Project Status:** Phase 13+ Complete; perturbative reduction v6 complete (Stage 7 closed 2026-04-20, issue #271 resolved). Euler–Heisenberg quartic-EM path fully supported; matter-only derivative-only theories now unblocked. 2,449 Python tests + 133 Wolfram test cases.

## Overview

The project is in a mature state with a robust symbolic pipeline from Lagrangian to PDE simulation. This roadmap tracks refinements toward production-grade reliability and extensibility.

**Total Identified Improvements:** 25 issues
**Estimated Effort:** 100-150 hours (6-8 sprint cycles)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal:** Address security concerns and high-impact bugs

| Issue                                                       | Priority    | Type     | Status  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ------- |
| [#67] Replace Assertions with Explicit Error Handling       | 🔴 Critical | Bug      | ✅ Done |
| [#68] Strengthen Mathematica Expression Evaluation Security | 🔴 Critical | Security | ✅ Done |
| [#75] Validate Grid Dimensions During PDE Construction      | 🟠 High     | Bug      | ✅ Done |

**Delivered:**

- All `assert isinstance()` replaced with explicit `TypeError` raises (Issue #67)
- `_validate_eval_result` checks for NaN/Inf/complex (Issue #68)
- `_validate_operator_dimensions()` at construction time (Issue #75)

---

### Phase 2: Testing & CI Infrastructure — ⏸️ PARKED (was "primary remaining focus" pre-pivot)

**Goal:** Improve test coverage and CI reliability
**Status:** Partially complete — coverage runs in CI, but key gaps remain

| Issue                                                      | Priority    | Type    | Status       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------ |
| [#73] Add Animation Module Test Coverage                   | 🟠 High     | Testing | ⛔ Obsolete  |
| [#74] Add Code Coverage Reporting to CI                    | 🟠 High     | CI/CD   | ✅ Done      |
| [#69] Add Wolfram Tests to GitHub Actions CI               | ⏸️ Parked   | CI/CD   | ⏸️ Parked    |
| [#78] Add Tests for Observers, Profiling, Runners Modules  | 🟡 Medium   | Testing | ⛔ Obsolete  |

**Delivered so far:**

- Coverage runs in CI (`--cov=tidal --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=xml`)
- Coverage uploaded to Codecov via `codecov/codecov-action@v5` (PR #74)

- Root Makefile with `make test-coverage` target

**Still needed:**

- codecov.io integration for dynamic badge and PR reports
- Optional Wolfram test workflow (label-triggered or weekly) — [#69]

**No longer applicable:** the animation, observers, profiling and runners test items
covered modules in the `kgsim` subpackage, which was deleted in `3940efdf`. Where the
functionality survived it is already covered (`tidal/measurement/_energy.py`,
`tidal/solver/progress.py`, the `tidal/solver/` backends); animation and profiling have
no successor module. Issues [#73] and [#78] are closed accordingly.
